=== Implementation Notes

* Cooperatives are uniquely identified by both ID and code
* Initial creation requires at least one translation in the default locale
* The code field must be unique and URL-friendly
* Geographical position uses longitude and latitude coordinates
* All cooperatives must be assigned to a specific ward
* Cooperative types are predefined enum values
* Status can be ACTIVE, INACTIVE, PENDING, or CLOSED
