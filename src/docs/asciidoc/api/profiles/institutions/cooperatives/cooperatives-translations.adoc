=== Implementation Notes

* Each cooperative can have multiple translations, but only one per locale
* The default locale translation must always exist and cannot be deleted
* Translations support full SEO metadata (title, description, keywords)
* Content status (DRAFT, PUBLISHED, ARCHIVED) tracks the publishing workflow
* Translations include structured data for SEO and social sharing
* Each translation can have its own slug URL for language-specific paths
