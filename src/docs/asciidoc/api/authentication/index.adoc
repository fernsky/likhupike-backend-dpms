The standard authentication flow is as follows:

1. A user registers using the registration endpoint
2. Admin approves the user
3. User logs in with email and password
4. User receives access and refresh tokens
5. Access token is used to access protected resources
6. When the access token expires, the refresh token can be used to get a new access token
