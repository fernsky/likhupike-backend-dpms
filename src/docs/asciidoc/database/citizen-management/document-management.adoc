===== Document State Enumeration
Each document has a state field that accepts the following values:

* `NOT_UPLOADED`: Document has not been uploaded yet
* `AWAITING_REVIEW`: Document has been uploaded and is waiting for review
* `REJECTED_BLURRY`: Document rejected because it is too blurry or unclear
* `REJECTED_UNSUITABLE`: Document rejected because it is unsuitable
* `REJECTED_MISMATCH`: Document rejected because it doesn't match other information
* `REJECTED_INCONSISTENT`: Document rejected because it doesn't match other documents
* `APPROVED`: Document has been approved

===== Storage Implementation

Document files are not stored directly in the database. Instead:

* Files are stored in an S3-compatible object storage (MinIO)
* The database stores only the storage key (path reference)
* Storage paths follow the pattern `citizens/{document_type}/{citizen_id}{extension}`
* Document access is controlled through presigned URLs with expiration

===== File Format Constraints

.File Format Constraints by Document Type
[cols="2,2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Document Type                    | Allowed Formats          | Maximum Size
| Citizen Photo                    | JPEG, PNG                | 5 MB
| Citizenship Certificate (Front)  | JPEG, PNG, PDF           | 10 MB
| Citizenship Certificate (Back)   | JPEG, PNG, PDF           | 10 MB

===== Document Workflow

* Initial document state is `NOT_UPLOADED`
* When uploaded by citizen, state changes to `AWAITING_REVIEW`
* Admin review changes state to either a rejection state with note or `APPROVED`
* Document state changes are independent of citizen state
* Documents can be resubmitted after rejection
* Document state changes are tracked with timestamps and user IDs
