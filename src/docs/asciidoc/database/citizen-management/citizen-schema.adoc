==== Design Considerations

===== Identification Strategy
* UUID-based primary keys for greater data portability
* Natural key lookups via citizenship_number and email
* All identification attributes indexed for efficient querying

===== Address Structure
* Hierarchical address storage with foreign keys to location entities
* Both permanent and temporary addresses maintained
* Composite ward references using both ward_number and municipality_code

===== Data Integrity
* Citizenship information stored with validation requirements
* Check constraints ensure data consistency
* Composite foreign keys for ward references ensure complete address integrity

===== Security Features
* Passwords stored using secure BCrypt hashing with work factor 10
* Careful separation of authentication and personal data
* Support for both self-registered and administrator-created citizens
