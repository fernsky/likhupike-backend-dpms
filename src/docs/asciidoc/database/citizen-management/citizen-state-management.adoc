==== Citizen State Management

The system implements a state management workflow for citizens, tracking their verification status.

===== State Enumeration
The `state` column accepts the following values:

* `PENDING_REGISTRATION`: Initial state for newly self-registered citizens
* `UNDER_REVIEW`: Citizen registration is being reviewed by an administrator
* `ACTION_REQUIRED`: Issues exist that require citizen action
* `REJECTED`: Registration has been rejected
* `APPROVED`: Registration has been fully verified and approved

===== State Transition Rules

.Valid State Transitions
[cols="2,3",options="header"]
|===
|Current State |Allowed Next States
|`PENDING_REGISTRATION` |`UNDER_REVIEW`, `ACTION_REQUIRED`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`
|`UNDER_REVIEW` |`ACTION_REQUIRED`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`
|`ACTION_REQUIRED` |`UNDER_REVIEW`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`
|`REJECTED` |`UNDER_REVIEW`, `ACTION_REQUIRED`
|`APPROVED` |`ACTION_REQUIRED`, `REJECTED`
|===

===== Approval Workflow

* Self-registered citizens begin in `PENDING_REGISTRATION` state and require explicit approval
* Administrator-created citizens can be immediately approved at creation
* Approval sets `is_approved = true` and updates approval audit fields
* Approval is separate from state transitions for independent tracking purposes
* Rejected citizens have `is_approved = false` but can be resubmitted for approval

===== Deletion Behavior

* Citizen records are never physically deleted
* Deletion is implemented via `is_deleted` flag
* Deleted citizens cannot authenticate but maintain full data history
* Deletion audit tracks the time and user who performed the deletion
