=== Summary of Major Changes

==== Initial Setup (`v0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`)
Focus on session management implementation with Spring Session integration.

==== Core Features (`v0.0.2-SNAPSHOT`)
Introduction of fundamental user management capabilities.

==== Security Enhancements (`v0.3.x-SNAPSHOT`)
Multiple releases focusing on security features and data consistency.

==== Production Release (`v1.0.1-SNAPSHOT`)
First stable release with complete documentation.

==== Role-Based Access Control (`v1.0.3-SNAPSHOT`)
Implementation of comprehensive role system with hierarchical permissions:

* Roles represent specific positions in the system (e.g., LAND_RECORDS_OFFICER)
* Users can be assigned multiple roles
* Users retain direct permissions that override role-based permissions
* Permissions can be assigned to roles to create permission groups
* Effective permissions combine both direct and role-derived permissions
* Spring Security integration for both role and permission-based authorization

==== Citizen Entity Implementation (`v1.0.4-SNAPSHOT`)
Extended the user system to support citizen profiles:

* Implemented JPA inheritance between User and Citizen entities
* Added support for storing citizen personal information
* Created storage system for citizen documents and photos
* Integrated with S3-compatible storage (MinIO) for document management
* Added unique constraints and indexes for efficient citizen lookups
* Enhanced entity model to support user specialization

==== Location Entity Improvements (`v1.0.5-SNAPSHOT`)
Significant refactoring of the location domain entities to improve data integrity and query performance:

* Fixed critical entity identification issues:
  * Implemented proper primary key handling in all location entities
  * Updated Province and District entities to use code field as primary key
  * Municipality entity now uses code as natural primary key
  * Ward entity now uses composite key (wardNumber + municipalityCode) with proper @IdClass implementation
* Standardized data access patterns:
  * Removed JPA metamodel dependencies in favor of string-based property access
  * Refactored specification implementation for consistent query building
  * Enhanced repository implementations with comprehensive documentation
* Performance optimizations:
  * Improved geo-spatial search capabilities
  * Added proper join handling in complex queries
  * Optimized count queries for paginated results
* Added comprehensive KDoc documentation across all components
