=== Technical Considerations

_Document technical considerations specific to geographical data:_

==== Spatial Data Management

* Use of PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
* Support for vector and raster data
* Spatial indexing for performance optimization
* Support for common coordinate reference systems

==== Map Rendering

* Server-side rendering for static maps
* Client-side rendering for interactive maps
* Tile-based approach for large datasets
* Caching strategies for frequently accessed areas

==== Coordinate Systems

* Standard coordinate reference system: WGS 84 (EPSG:4326)
* Support for local projections when needed
* Coordinate transformation utilities
* Handling of legacy coordinate data

==== Performance Optimization

* Spatial data partitioning
* Query optimization for spatial operations
* Caching of complex geometries
* Progressive loading of large datasets

==== Data Volume Considerations

* Scalability planning for large municipalities
* Storage optimization for geometries
* Archiving strategy for historical data
* Backup and recovery procedures for spatial data
