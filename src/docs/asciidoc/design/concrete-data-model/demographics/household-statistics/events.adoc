### Event Handling Best Practices

1. **Idempotency**: All event handlers should be designed to be idempotent to handle possible duplicate events.

2. **Transactional Boundaries**: Events should be published only after successful completion of the transaction that generated them.

3. **Security Context**: The `actorId` should be included in all events to maintain audit trails and security context.

4. **Serialization**: Events should be designed to be easily serializable for storage and message passing.

5. **Versioning**: Event schemas should include versioning to handle evolutionary changes.

### Event Flow Architecture

The diagram above illustrates the event flow architecture used in the Household Statistics domain, showing how events are published transactionally after data changes are committed, and then processed by various subscribers.

### Nepal-Specific Event Considerations

1. **Multilingual Event Content**: Event data in Nepal often needs to support both Nepali and English content to serve different government stakeholders.

2. **Disaster Response Coordination**: Events related to household disasters trigger specialized workflows that coordinate with Nepal's disaster management authorities.

3. **Federal Structure Integration**: Events cascade through Nepal's federal structure, triggering appropriate actions at national, provincial, and local levels.

4. **Seasonal Data Collection Awareness**: Event timing is sensitive to Nepal's seasonal challenges, with certain events triggering different responses during monsoon season versus dry season.

5. **Remittance Economy Integration**: Events related to household economics have specialized handling to account for Nepal's remittance-dependent economy and foreign employment patterns.
