===== Time Series Collection Frequencies

The system supports multiple collection frequencies for household statistics time series data:

* *Decennial Census Data*: Comprehensive baseline data collected every 10 years
* *Annual Survey Data*: Regular surveys with smaller sample sizes but annual coverage
* *Quarterly Monitoring*: Targeted data collection for specific indicators in selected areas
* *Post-Event Surveys*: Special collections following disasters or significant social changes
* *Continuous Panel Studies*: Ongoing tracking of selected household panels

===== Nepal-Specific Time Series Implementation

The household time series implements specialized handling for Nepal-specific temporal patterns:

1. **Nepali Calendar Integration**: Time series data can be stored and retrieved using both Gregorian (CE) and Bikram Sambat (BS) calendar systems, essential for aligning with official Nepal government statistics which use BS dates for all reporting.

2. **Census Cycle Management**: Accommodates Nepal's 10-year census cycle with specialized interpolation for the inter-censal period, addressing the scarcity of comprehensive data between major census operations.

3. **Methodology Transition Handling**: Implements statistical adjustments when methodologies change between collection periods, which occurred significantly between the 2001, 2011, and 2021 Nepal censuses as collection methods modernized.

4. **Seasonal Adjustment Factors**: Accounts for Nepal's monsoon season impact on data collection, adjusting for systematic variations in reporting and collection quality during June-September when access to remote areas is limited.

===== Interpolation Strategies for Household Data

The system implements multiple interpolation strategies to address data gaps common in Nepal's challenging data collection environment:

1. **Rural-Urban Differentiated Interpolation**: Applies different interpolation models for rural areas (which change more slowly) versus urban areas (with more rapid demographic transitions)

2. **Topography-Based Adjustment**: Adjusts interpolation models based on geographic region (Mountain, Hill, Terai) to account for region-specific demographic patterns

3. **Remittance-Sensitive Modeling**: Incorporates international migration patterns and remittance flow data when interpolating household economic indicators, critical in a country where remittances represent about 25% of GDP

4. **Disaster Impact Adjustment**: Specially flags periods following major disasters (like the 2015 earthquake) where normal interpolation models are inappropriate and reconstruction-specific models are applied

===== Real-World Application: Tracking Post-Earthquake Housing Recovery

An important use case for the household time series management is tracking housing recovery following the 2015 Nepal earthquake. The system implements specialized time series tracking that:

1. Establishes pre-earthquake baseline housing conditions from the 2011 Census
2. Integrates post-earthquake damage assessment data as an extraordinary data point
3. Tracks reconstruction progress through quarterly updates from the National Reconstruction Authority
4. Monitors housing quality improvements (building materials, earthquake resistance features) over time
5. Compares recovery rates across affected districts to identify areas needing additional support
6. Projects full recovery timelines based on reconstruction trends

This implementation enables government agencies to measure not just recovery to pre-disaster conditions, but to track "build back better" improvements in housing quality that increase resilience to future earthquakes.
