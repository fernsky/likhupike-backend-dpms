The diagram above illustrates how events flow through the system when gender distribution data is created or updated. The process demonstrates several key patterns:

1. **Event-Driven Data Quality Assurance**: Data quality checks are triggered automatically after creation events, ensuring all gender data is validated for consistency and plausibility.

2. **Automatic Analysis Workflows**: The creation of a gender distribution automatically triggers specialized analysis processes including imbalance detection and migration impact assessment.

3. **Stakeholder Notification**: Relevant stakeholders are notified of gender data changes that affect their domains, ensuring that gender-responsive planning is based on the latest information.

4. **Audit Trail**: All events are recorded for audit purposes, maintaining transparency and traceability in gender data management.

5. **Search Indexing**: New and updated gender data is automatically indexed for search capabilities, enabling efficient discovery of gender patterns.

==== Event Application Use Cases

===== Gender-Based Migration Analysis in Rural Communities

When gender distribution data is updated for a rural municipality, the system needs to identify potential migration impacts:

1. The `GenderDistributionCreatedEvent` triggers an automatic migration impact analysis.
2. The MigrationAnalysisService detects a highly skewed sex ratio (75 males per 100 females) in working-age cohorts.
3. The `GenderMigrationImpactAssessedEvent` is published with impactLevel = HIGH.
4. This notifies the Local Development Office about potential social impacts of high male outmigration.
5. The system recommends interventions for female-headed households, using gender demographic data to estimate their prevalence.

This process ensures local governments can respond appropriately to gendered migration patterns, particularly in Nepal's hill and mountain districts where male outmigration has transformed community structures and created new social support needs.

===== Third Gender Inclusion Planning

When analyzing demographic data for urban areas:

1. A `GenderDistributionCreatedEvent` includes third gender population data for a municipality.
2. The system automatically triggers specialized third gender data analysis.
3. The `ThirdGenderDataAnalyzedEvent` identifies concentrations in specific wards.
4. This information supports targeted service planning for the third gender community.
5. Stakeholders in social inclusion programs are automatically notified about the demographic pattern.

This process supports Nepal's legal recognition of third gender by providing evidence-based data for inclusive service planning, aligning with Nepal's constitutional guarantees of equal rights regardless of gender identity.

===== Gender Demographic Impact of Development Projects

When analyzing the impacts of a major development project:

1. The `GenderDistributionComparedEvent` compares pre-project and current gender distributions.
2. The event captures key differences in gender balance, identifying a sudden increase in male population due to project workers.
3. This triggers notifications to local services about potential impacts on community gender dynamics.
4. The comparative data informs adjustments to social services to accommodate the temporary demographic shift.

This process helps manage demographic transition impacts from development activities, a common issue in Nepal where large infrastructure projects can temporarily transform local gender balances.

===== Gender-Responsive Budget Planning

When provincial officials are planning resource allocation:

1. The `GenderDistributionAggregatedEvent` provides province-level gender data aggregated from constituent municipalities.
2. Gender analysis services use this data to identify districts with high gender disparities in education.
3. The budgeting system receives notifications about priority areas for gender-responsive interventions.
4. Resources are allocated proportionally to address identified gender gaps.

This process supports Nepal's constitutionally-mandated gender-responsive budgeting, ensuring resource allocation is informed by accurate gender demographic data that highlights areas of greatest need.

==== Nepal-Specific Event Considerations

1. **Administrative Restructuring**: Events include mechanisms to handle Nepal's administrative boundary changes, particularly important since the 2017 federal restructuring that significantly altered the administrative geography.

2. **Seasonal Migration Patterns**: Events related to migration impact assessment are designed to differentiate between permanent demographic changes and Nepal's significant seasonal migration patterns.

3. **Census Cycle Alignment**: Events are designed to handle the transition between Nepal's 10-year census cycles, with different validation approaches for census years versus intercensal estimates.

4. **Third Gender Reporting Evolution**: Special handling for third gender data acknowledges the evolving nature of third gender reporting and recognition in Nepal, which has progressed significantly since initial recognition in 2007.

5. **Disaster Impact Analysis**: Special events track gender demographic shifts following disasters, essential in Nepal's context where earthquakes, floods, and landslides can cause significant population displacements that often have gender-specific patterns.

These Nepal-specific considerations ensure that the event architecture addresses the country's unique gender demographic context and administrative requirements, providing a foundation for evidence-based gender-responsive planning across all levels of governance.

===== Gender Event Integration with Other Domains

The gender distribution events integrate with multiple other domains to provide comprehensive gender analysis:

1. **Health Domain Integration**: Gender demographic events trigger notifications to health planning systems about changes in female reproductive-age populations that affect maternal health service requirements.

2. **Education Domain Integration**: Gender distribution data flows to education planning systems to support gender-equitable education resource allocation and identify areas with gender gaps in educational access.

3. **Economic Domain Integration**: Gender distributions by occupation and education level provide critical inputs to economic planning, particularly for employment programs targeting gender-specific economic challenges.

4. **Social Protection Domain Integration**: Gender demographic patterns, especially female-headed households in high male outmigration areas, inform social protection interventions and support program design.

5. **Infrastructure Domain Integration**: Gender distribution data influences infrastructure planning to ensure gender-responsive design, such as safe transportation options in areas with high female mobility needs.

This cross-domain integration ensures that gender demographic insights inform planning across sectors, supporting Nepal's whole-of-government approach to gender equality as mandated by the constitution and national gender policies.

===== Privacy and Sensitivity Considerations

Gender demographic events implement several safeguards for sensitive data:

1. **Third Gender Data Protection**: Specialized anonymization protocols for third gender data in areas with small populations to prevent potential identification.

2. **Gender-Based Violence Correlation Protection**: Controls on event data that could link gender demographics to gender-based violence statistics to prevent misuse of sensitive information.

3. **Role-Based Access**: Different event subscriptions based on user roles to ensure sensitive gender analysis is only available to authorized stakeholders.

4. **Geographic Restriction**: Event access limited by administrative jurisdiction, ensuring local gender data is only accessible to relevant authorities.

5. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logs of all gender data event access to maintain accountability.

These measures ensure compliance with Nepal's privacy regulations while enabling appropriate data sharing for planning purposes, balancing transparency with protection of sensitive demographic information.
