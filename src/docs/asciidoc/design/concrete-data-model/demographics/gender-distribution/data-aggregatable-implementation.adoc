The GenderDistribution entity's implementation of DataAggregatable provides powerful aggregation capabilities to support gender-specific demographic analysis across Nepal's administrative hierarchy and over time periods.

===== Spatial Aggregation Implementation

Spatial aggregation enables the combination of gender data from lower administrative levels to create aggregated distributions for higher administrative units, supporting Nepal's multi-tiered administrative structure.

*Administrative Hierarchy Validation*

Before performing spatial aggregation, the system validates that the specified source distributions form a complete set for the target administrative unit:

1. **Completeness Check**: Ensures all constituent units of the target administrative area are represented in the source data
2. **Boundary Validation**: Confirms administrative boundaries have not changed between data collection periods
3. **Hierarchical Consistency**: Validates that all source data belongs to the same administrative level

This validation is particularly important in Nepal's context where the 2017 federal restructuring created new administrative boundaries, and ensuring data aggregation respects these boundaries is critical for accurate analysis.

*Gender-Specific Aggregation Methodology*

The aggregation process applies specialized methods for gender data:

1. **Population Counts**: Direct summation of male, female, and third gender population counts

2. **Gender Ratio Calculation**: Recalculation of sex ratio based on the aggregated gender counts rather than averaging the ratios of constituent units

3. **Third Gender Data Handling**: Special handling for third gender data, which often has smaller counts and requires statistical smoothing when aggregating

4. **Data Quality Weighting**: For survey-based data, weighting is applied based on sample size and confidence intervals

*Confidence Level Propagation*

The system propagates confidence information during aggregation:

1. **Lowest Common Confidence**: The aggregated distribution typically receives the lowest confidence level of any constituent distribution

2. **Sample Size Adjustment**: For survey-based data, confidence levels may be elevated when combining sufficient sample sizes

3. **Methodological Discrepancy Penalty**: Confidence is reduced when combining data collected through different methodologies

4. **Missing Data Impact**: Partial data coverage results in confidence level reduction

*Special Considerations for Nepal*

Several specialized aggregation features address Nepal's unique context:

1. **Male Migration Adjustment**: In districts with high male outmigration, the system can apply migration-adjusted aggregation that accounts for temporarily absent populations when requested

2. **Caste/Ethnicity Correlation**: Optional parallel aggregation of gender data by major ethnic/caste groups to preserve important social dimensions

3. **Urban-Rural Distinction**: Ability to maintain urban-rural distinctions during upward aggregation to preserve important demographic differences

4. **Post-Disaster Displacement**: Special aggregation modes for post-disaster periods that can account for population displacement

===== Temporal Aggregation Implementation

Temporal aggregation enables analysis of gender distribution trends over time and supports various time-based analysis methods.

*Time Period Selection*

The system supports flexible time period selection for aggregation:

1. **Census Periods**: Aggregation between official census periods (2001, 2011, 2021)
2. **Custom Ranges**: User-defined time periods for specific analysis needs
3. **Plan-Aligned Periods**: Time frames aligned with Five-Year Development Plan periods
4. **Pre/Post Event Analysis**: Periods defined relative to significant events (e.g., pre/post federal restructuring)

*Data Continuity Validation*

Before temporal aggregation, the system validates time series consistency:

1. **Coverage Check**: Ensures consistent administrative coverage across time periods
2. **Methodological Breaks**: Identifies and flags changes in data collection methodology
3. **Classification Changes**: Adjusts for changes in gender classification (particularly relevant for third gender recognition, which was formally introduced in the 2011 census)

*Multiple Temporal Aggregation Methods*

The system supports different approaches to temporal aggregation:

1. **Averaging**: Calculating mean values across the time period, useful for smoothing short-term fluctuations

2. **Trend Analysis**: Computing trend lines to characterize gender proportion changes:
   - Sex ratio trends
   - Third gender reporting trends
   - Gender balance category shifts

3. **Endpoint Comparison**: Analyzing net change between the start and end of a period:
   - Net change in gender counts and ratios
   - Proportional changes in gender distribution
   - Categorical shifts in gender balance

4. **Custom Methods**: Specialized aggregation for specific needs:
   - Weighted temporal averages giving preference to more recent data
   - Bayesian methods for small area statistics
   - Gap-filling for incomplete time series

*Gender-Specific Time Series Considerations*

Several temporal factors specific to gender data in Nepal are addressed:

1. **Third Gender Reporting Evolution**: Special handling for the evolving nature of third gender data collection, which has changed significantly over census periods

2. **Migration Effect Isolation**: Techniques to separate gender distribution changes due to migration from those caused by other demographic factors

3. **Data Collection Timing Effects**: Adjustment for seasonal male migration that can affect gender distributions depending on when data was collected

4. **Incremental Census Roll-Out**: Methods to account for the phased collection of Nepal's census data, which can span several months with different regions enumerated at different times

*Implementation Considerations*

Several optimizations support efficient temporal aggregation:

1. **Caching Strategy**: Common temporal aggregations are cached to improve performance

2. **Computational Efficiency**: Algorithms optimized for sparse time series data, common in Nepal's data environment

3. **Quality Flagging**: Clear identification of periods with lower data quality

4. **Metadata Preservation**: Detailed tracking of which methodologies were used in different time periods

This DataAggregatable implementation enables sophisticated analysis of gender demographic patterns across both administrative hierarchies and time periods, accounting for Nepal's complex administrative history and diverse data collection methodologies.
