The AgeDistribution entity implements DataAggregatable to support two critical aggregation capabilities:

1. **Spatial Aggregation**: Combining ward-level age distributions to create aggregated distributions for higher administrative levels (municipality, district, province, country)
2. **Temporal Aggregation**: Synthesizing multiple time points to generate trend data, averages, or comparison analyses over time

===== Spatial Aggregation Implementation

The spatial aggregation capability supports Nepal's multi-level administrative structure, allowing demographic analysis at any administrative level by aggregating data from lower levels.

*Administrative Hierarchy Validation*

Before aggregation begins, the system validates that the specified source distributions form a complete set for the target administrative unit. This is particularly important in Nepal's context because:

- The 2017 administrative restructuring created complex relationships between old and new administrative units
- Some wards may have missing data or different data collection periods
- Administrative boundaries occasionally change, requiring validation that the data represents consistent geographic areas

*Age Group Aggregation Methodology*

When aggregating age distributions across administrative areas, several methodological considerations are addressed:

1. **Direct Count Aggregation**: For complete census-based data, age groups are directly summed across the source administrative units.

2. **Sample-Based Aggregation**: For survey-based data, the system applies appropriate statistical methods including:
   - Weighting based on sampling methodology
   - Confidence interval calculations for aggregated estimates
   - Adjustment for different sampling rates across areas

3. **Heterogeneous Data Sources**: When aggregating distributions from different data sources (e.g., some census-based, some survey-based), the system:
   - Prioritizes more reliable data sources
   - Applies appropriate weighting based on data quality
   - Clearly indicates the mixed methodology in metadata

*Weighted Demographic Indices*

While raw population counts are simply summed, demographic indices require more sophisticated aggregation:

1. **Median Age**: Calculated from the aggregated age distribution rather than averaging median ages
2. **Dependency Ratios**: Recalculated from the summed population in relevant age groups
3. **Age-Gender Ratios**: Derived from the summed gender-specific age distributions

*Confidence Level Propagation*

The system propagates confidence information during aggregation, accounting for:

1. **Varying Data Quality**: Different administrative areas may have different data quality
2. **Temporal Distance**: Data further from collection point has lower confidence
3. **Mixed Methodologies**: Combination of census and estimated data affects confidence
4. **Completeness**: Missing areas or age groups reduce confidence

The aggregated distribution receives a confidence level representing the lowest common denominator of source distributions, ensuring users understand potential limitations in the aggregated data.

*Edge Cases and Special Considerations*

Several edge cases are handled to ensure accurate aggregation:

1. **Zero Population Areas**: Some administrative areas may be uninhabited (especially in national park or high mountain regions) and are properly handled in aggregations.

2. **Single Age Source Breakdown**: When more detailed age breakdowns exist for some areas but not others, the system aggregates to the lowest common denominator while preserving the more detailed data for those specific areas.

3. **Disputed Areas**: Administrative areas with boundary disputes are flagged, and age distributions from these areas include appropriate caveats.

4. **Special Populations**: Areas with unusual population characteristics (military bases, university campuses, industrial zones) are noted in metadata as they may skew age distributions.

===== Temporal Aggregation Implementation

The temporal aggregation capability enables analysis of age distribution trends over time, supporting both short-term comparisons and long-term demographic trend analysis.

*Time Period Selection*

The system supports flexible time period selection for aggregation:

1. **Standard Intervals**: Census periods (typically 10 years), 5-year planning periods, or annual data
2. **Custom Ranges**: User-defined time periods for specific analysis needs
3. **Pre/Post Event Analysis**: Periods defined relative to significant events (e.g., pre/post 2015 earthquake)

*Data Continuity Validation*

Before temporal aggregation, the system validates data continuity to ensure meaningful aggregation:

1. **Coverage Check**: Ensures consistent administrative coverage across time periods
2. **Methodological Breaks**: Identifies and adjusts for changes in data collection methodology
3. **Boundary Changes**: Flags and adjusts for administrative boundary changes between periods
4. **Missing Periods**: Determines whether gaps in time series data affect aggregation validity

*Multiple Temporal Aggregation Methods*

The system supports different temporal aggregation approaches:

1. **Averaging**: Calculating mean values across the time period, useful for smoothing short-term fluctuations

2. **Trend Analysis**: Computing trend lines (linear, exponential, logarithmic) to characterize change over time:
   - Age-specific growth rates
   - Cohort progression patterns
   - Dependency ratio trends

3. **Endpoint Comparison**: Analyzing net change between the start and end of a period:
   - Total change (absolute numbers)
   - Percentage change
   - Structural change (shift in proportions)

4. **Custom Methods**: Specialized aggregation for specific analysis needs:
   - Weighted temporal averages
   - Bayesian projections
   - Statistical mixture models

*Time-Series Visualization*

Temporal aggregations are designed to support rich visualization options:

1. **Animation-Ready Data**: Time series outputs structured for animated visualizations
2. **Comparable Time Points**: Consistent age bands across time for valid comparisons
3. **Uncertainty Bands**: Confidence intervals that reflect increasing uncertainty in older data

*Special Considerations for Nepal's Context*

Temporal aggregation addresses several factors specific to Nepal's demographic context:

1. **Intercensal Estimation**: Between census years (2001, 2011, 2021), providing consistent estimation methods

2. **Civil Conflict Period**: Special handling for the 1996-2006 period when data collection was disrupted in many areas

3. **Post-Earthquake Displacement**: Adjustments for the 2015 earthquake's effect on population distribution

4. **Migration Effects**: Correction for Nepal's high rural-urban and international migration rates that affect age structures over time

5. **Changing Administrative Units**: Reconciliation of data across Nepal's 2017 transition from 75 districts to 77 districts and from VDCs to rural municipalities

*Implementation Considerations*

The DataAggregatable implementation includes several optimizations for Nepal's data environment:

1. **Caching Strategy**: Commonly requested aggregations (district and province levels) are cached

2. **Computational Efficiency**: Optimized algorithms for large-scale aggregations across Nepal's 6,743 wards

3. **Data Quality Flagging**: Clear indication of lower-quality input data that affects aggregation results

4. **Hybrid Data Integration**: Methods to combine census, survey, and administrative data in coherent aggregations

This implementation enables demographic analysis at any administrative level and across flexible time periods, accounting for Nepal's complex administrative history and diverse data quality across regions.
