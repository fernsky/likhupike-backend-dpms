| timestamp | When the event occurred
| actorId | User or system that created the distribution
|===

*Business Impact:* This event initiates various secondary processes including data quality checks, notification to analysts, and updating of administrative area population totals. In Nepal's context, new age distribution data is particularly significant as it influences resource allocation formulas used by ministries to distribute development funds to local governments.

===== AgeDistributionUpdatedEvent

Triggered when changes are made to existing age distribution data.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]

| timestamp | When the event occurred
| actorId | User who made the update
|===

*Business Impact:* This event may trigger recalculation of demographic indicators, re-aggregation of higher-level administrative areas, and notifications to stakeholders about changed data. For Nepal, the ability to track changes is especially important when reconciling data from multiple government agencies that may have different methodologies.

===== AgeDistributionImportedEvent

Triggered when age distribution data is imported from an external source.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Attribute | Description

| hadErrors | Whether there were errors during import
| errorSummary | Summary of any errors encountered
| timestamp | When the import occurred
| actorId | User who performed the import
|===

*Business Impact:* Data import is a common operation in Nepal's decentralized statistical system, where data may originate from multiple sources including the Central Bureau of Statistics, ministry field offices, and international organizations. This event initiates data validation processes and ensures proper attribution of data sources.

==== Specialized Domain Events

===== AgeDistributionQualityCheckedEvent

Triggered when quality checks are performed on age distribution data.

| checkResults | Results of individual quality checks
| passedAllChecks | Whether all checks were passed
| suggestedActions | Suggested actions for failed checks
| timestamp | When checks were performed
| actorId | User or system that performed the checks
|===

*Business Impact:* Data quality is a significant concern in Nepal's demographic data, particularly regarding age heaping and digit preference. This event allows systems to flag potentially problematic data patterns, especially important for remote regions where direct validation is challenging.

===== AgeStructureAnalyzedEvent

Triggered when a structural analysis of age distribution is completed.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]

This event can trigger notifications to relevant ministries when specific demographic patterns are detected, such as rapidly aging populations that require expanded elder care services or youth bulges that signal future workforce expansion needs.

===== AgeDistributionProjectedEvent

Triggered when a new age distribution projection is created for a future year.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Attribute | Description

The diagram above illustrates how events flow through the system when age distribution data is created or updated. The process demonstrates several key patterns:

1. **Event-Driven Quality Assurance**: Data quality checks are triggered automatically after creation events, ensuring all data is validated.

2. **Hierarchical Propagation**: Events trigger aggregation to higher administrative levels, maintaining consistency throughout the hierarchy.

3. **Stakeholder Notification**: Relevant stakeholders are notified of data changes that affect their domains.

4. **Audit Trail**: All events are recorded for audit purposes, maintaining transparency and traceability.

5. **Search Indexing**: New and updated data is automatically indexed for search capabilities.

==== Event Application Use Cases

===== Tracking Demographic Transition in a Local Area

When age distribution data is updated for a municipality, the system needs to track demographic transition phases and notify relevant stakeholders:

1. The `AgeStructureAnalyzedEvent` identifies a shift from an EXPANSIVE to a TRANSITIONAL age structure.
2. This triggers notifications to the local government about changing service needs.
3. Planning systems are updated with information about anticipated shifts in school enrollment, healthcare demand, and workforce dynamics.
4. The local government dashboard highlights the transition with comparative pyramid visualizations showing the structural shift.

This process ensures local governments in Nepal can adapt their development plans to emerging demographic realities, particularly important as the country undergoes rapid demographic transition with significant regional variations.

===== Cross-Border Migration Analysis

When anomalies are detected in age-specific populations for border municipalities:

1. The `AnomalyDetectedEvent` flags unusual patterns in working-age male cohorts.
2. Migration analysis systems compare the patterns with known migration corridors.
3. The labor ministry receives notifications about potential changes in outmigration patterns.
4. Local governments along the identified corridors receive alerts to prepare for potential service impacts.

This process is especially relevant for Nepal given its open border with India and significant international labor migration, which creates distinctive demographic signatures in source communities.

===== Population Projection for Infrastructure Planning

When the national planning commission requires updated projections for a major infrastructure project:

1. The `AgeDistributionProjectedEvent` generates projections for the project area through 2040.
2. Sectoral planning systems receive notifications about the new projections.
3. The infrastructure sizing algorithm incorporates the new population forecasts.
4. Financial planning systems update long-term cost estimates based on the projected service population.

This ensures that major infrastructure investments in Nepal, often with 25+ year lifespans, are properly sized for future population needs, avoiding both under-capacity and wasteful overbuilding.

==== Nepal-Specific Event Considerations

1. **Administrative Restructuring**: Events include mechanisms to handle Nepal's administrative boundary changes, particularly important since the 2017 federal restructuring that significantly altered the administrative geography.

2. **Seasonal Migration Patterns**: Events related to anomaly detection are designed to differentiate between permanent demographic changes and Nepal's significant seasonal migration patterns, particularly in agricultural regions.

3. **Census Cycle Alignment**: Events are designed to handle the transition between Nepal's 10-year census cycles, with different validation approaches for census years versus intercensal estimates.

4. **Multi-Language Support**: Events include support for both Nepali and English content, reflecting Nepal's bilingual administrative environment.

5. **Disaster Impact Analysis**: Special events track demographic shifts following disasters, essential in Nepal's context where earthquakes, floods, and landslides can cause significant population displacements.

These Nepal-specific considerations ensure that the event architecture addresses the country's unique demographic context and administrative requirements, providing a foundation for evidence-based planning across all levels of governance.

===== Integration with National Standards

The event system integrates with Nepal's national data standards, including:

1. **CBS Data Protocols**: Alignment with Central Bureau of Statistics data classification standards
2. **National ID Integration**: Capability to link with Nepal's National ID program for population verification
3. **Federal Structure Mapping**: Mapping to the official administrative codes from the Ministry of Federal Affairs
4. **Electronic Government Procurement System**: Structured data formats compatible with Nepal's e-GP system
5. **Digital Nepal Framework**: Conformance with interoperability standards from the Digital Nepal initiative

This standards alignment ensures that demographic events can seamlessly integrate with other government systems, supporting Nepal's digital transformation goals.

===== Security and Privacy Considerations

Given the sensitivity of demographic data, the event system implements several safeguards:

1. **Data Anonymization**: Population aggregations enforce minimum thresholds for small areas
2. **Role-Based Access**: Different event subscriptions based on user roles
3. **Geographic Restriction**: Event access limited by administrative jurisdiction
4. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logs of all event access
5. **Privacy by Design**: Events structured to minimize inclusion of potentially sensitive data

These measures ensure compliance with Nepal's privacy regulations while enabling appropriate data sharing for planning purposes.
