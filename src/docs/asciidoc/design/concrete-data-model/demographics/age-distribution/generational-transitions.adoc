*Real-World Context:*
Nepal has undergone profound social, political, and economic transformations since 1990, including the transition from monarchy to republic, a decade-long civil conflict, major constitutional reforms, and most recently, the shift to a federal structure. These changes have created distinct generational cohorts with significantly different experiences, values, and expectations. The National Planning Commission needs to understand these generational dynamics to develop forward-looking policies that account for changing demographic realities.

The AgeDistribution entity enables sophisticated analysis of these generational transitions by providing the foundation for cohort tracking across multiple censuses from 1981 to 2021. This longitudinal view reveals how different birth cohorts have progressed through Nepal's demographic and social history.

The analysis begins by defining Nepal-specific generational cohorts based on pivotal historical events rather than applying Western generational concepts:

1. **Pre-Conflict Generation** (born before 1980): Grew up during the Panchayat era, often with limited education, predominantly agricultural livelihoods, and traditional social values.

2. **Conflict Generation** (born 1980-1996): Came of age during Nepal's civil conflict and political transitions, experienced disrupted education, and pioneered international labor migration.

3. **Post-Conflict Generation** (born 1997-2006): First generation to grow up with expanded education access, increased urbanization, and significant media exposure during Nepal's peace process.

4. **Federal Generation** (born after 2006): Growing up in Nepal's new federal structure, with digital connectivity, declining family size, and exposure to global influences.

The AgeDistribution entity enables tracking the relative size and progression of these cohorts. For example, the analysis reveals that the "Conflict Generation" is now entering leadership positions in society, constituting approximately 30% of Nepal's population, while the rapidly growing "Federal Generation" already represents about 25% of the population.

The GenerationalTransition service extends this demographic analysis to include socioeconomic and attitudinal shifts between generations. By integrating census and survey data, it quantifies dramatic intergenerational changes:

- Educational attainment increasing from under 40% literacy in the Pre-Conflict Generation to over 90% in the Federal Generation
- Family size preferences declining from 4+ children in the Pre-Conflict Generation to fewer than 2 in the Post-Conflict Generation  
- Urban residence rising from 7% in the Pre-Conflict Generation to over 40% in the Federal Generation
- Female workforce participation expanding from under 20% in formal employment for the Pre-Conflict Generation to over 50% for the Post-Conflict Generation
- Religious observance and traditional practices significantly declining in younger generations

The CohortAnalysisEngine uses age distribution data to identify transition points when younger generations will become the demographic majority in different contexts. This analysis reveals that by 2030, the Post-Conflict and Federal Generations combined will constitute over 70% of Nepal's adult population, representing a fundamental shift in the country's social and political power balance.

For policymaking, the analysis highlights several critical transition implications:

1. **Governance Transformation**: As digitally literate, better-educated generations gain demographic dominance, expectations for governance transparency and service delivery will fundamentally change.

2. **Economic Model Shifts**: Younger generations show significantly lower interest in agricultural livelihoods and higher entrepreneurial aspirations, necessitating economic policy adjustments.

3. **Social Protection Challenges**: With smaller families and increased mobility, traditional family-based elderly care systems are weakening, requiring new social protection approaches.

4. **Remittance Economy Evolution**: Younger generations show different migration patterns and savings behaviors, with implications for Nepal's remittance-dependent economy.

5. **Value System Changes**: Significant intergenerational differences in gender attitudes, marriage preferences, and community engagement require adaptive social policies.

The AgeDistribution entity's spatial disaggregation capabilities enable analysis of how these generational transitions vary geographically. For example, in urban Kathmandu, the Post-Conflict and Federal Generations already constitute the majority of the adult population, while in remote mountain districts, the Pre-Conflict Generation still dominates leadership positions and social norms.

The visualization capabilities make these complex generational shifts accessible to policymakers through interactive dashboards, cohort flow diagrams, and geographic transition maps. These tools help the National Planning Commission develop policies aligned with Nepal's rapidly evolving generational landscape.

===== Special Considerations for Nepal's Context

Several unique factors shape Nepal's generational transitions:

1. **Civil Conflict Impacts**: The 1996-2006 conflict created distinctive formative experiences for an entire generation, including disrupted education and forced migration.

2. **Migration Influence**: Large-scale international labor migration has created "transnational generations" with hybrid identities and experiences.

3. **Technological Leapfrogging**: Nepal moved directly from limited connectivity to widespread mobile technology, creating stark digital divides between generations.

4. **Caste/Ethnic Dimensions**: Generational changes in caste and ethnic identity vary significantly, with younger generations often having different relationships to traditional hierarchies.

5. **Federalism Implementation**: The ongoing implementation of federalism creates different generational impacts across Nepal's diverse regions.

The age distribution analysis enables nuanced understanding of these Nepal-specific factors, supporting policymaking that accounts for the country's unique generational dynamics and transition patterns.
