Key features of literacy rate maps include:

1. **Customizable Classification**: Users can apply different classification schemes (natural breaks, quantiles, equal intervals) to highlight different patterns in the data.

2. **Multi-Category Visualization**: Rather than just overall literacy, maps can display female literacy, youth literacy, or linguistic literacy rates.

3. **Administrative Level Control**: Maps can be generated at any administrative level with drill-down capabilities from national to ward level.

4. **Literacy Gap Overlay**: Option to overlay gender literacy gaps or urban-rural literacy disparities to visualize multiple dimensions simultaneously.

5. **Time Animation**: Ability to animate maps across multiple census years to show changes in literacy patterns over time.

*Literacy Comparison Chart*

This visualization compares literacy rates across administrative areas, demographic groups, or time periods in a bar or column format.

Key features of literacy trend visualization include:

1. **Event Annotation**: Important events affecting literacy (e.g., education policy changes, conflict periods, major disasters) can be marked on the timeline.

2. **Multi-Series Comparison**: Display of overall, male, female, and age-specific literacy trends in the same chart for gap analysis.

3. **Projection Extension**: Trend lines can include projections with confidence intervals based on historical patterns and demographic projections.

4. **Milestone Highlighting**: Target years or benchmark achievements can be visually emphasized on the timeline.

5. **Comparative Trends**: Option to display multiple administrative areas on the same trend chart for comparative trajectory analysis.

*Educational Attainment Pyramid*

This visualization displays the population distribution across different educational attainment levels, often with gender comparison.

Key features of educational attainment pyramids include:

1. **Gender Comparison**: Side-by-side display of male and female educational achievement to visualize gender gaps at different education levels.

2. **Age Cohort Options**: Ability to filter by age cohorts to observe generational changes in educational attainment.

3. **Comparative Overlays**: Options to compare different time periods or different administrative areas using outline overlays.

4. **Completion Rate Highlights**: Special highlighting for key educational transition points (primary completion, secondary completion).

5. **Benchmark Indicators**: Visual indicators for national targets or international comparison points.

===== Advanced Visualization Features

*Multilingual Literacy Visualizations*

Specialized visualizations for Nepal's multilingual context:

1. **Language Literacy Map**: Geographic visualization of literacy in different languages across Nepal's diverse linguistic landscape

2. **Mother Tongue vs. Official Language**: Comparative visualization of literacy rates in mother tongue compared to literacy in Nepal's official language

3. **Script Distribution**: Visualization of literacy by script (Devanagari, Tibetan, etc.) in areas with multiple writing systems

4. **Language Transition Analysis**: Visualization of educational pathways from mother tongue instruction to official language mastery

*Education Access Visualization*

Visualizations focused on the physical and social dimensions of education access:

1. **School Proximity Maps**: Heat maps showing distance to educational facilities overlaid with literacy rates

2. **Teacher-Student Ratio Analysis**: Visualization of teacher availability correlated with literacy outcomes

3. **School Completion Flow**: Sankey diagrams showing student flow from enrollment through various education levels to completion

4. **Dropout Pattern Visualization**: Visual analysis of where and when students leave the education system

*Functional Literacy Analysis*

3. **Culturally Appropriate Color Schemes**: Use of culturally neutral color schemes that avoid problematic color associations

4. **Local Administrative Names**: Use of official Nepali terminology for administrative divisions

*Accessibility Features*

Visualizations implement accessibility best practices:

1. **Color Blindness Safe**: All color schemes tested for color vision deficiencies

2. **Screen Reader Support**: Text equivalents for all visual elements

3. **Data Table Alternatives**: All visual data available in accessible tabular format

4. **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design for Nepal's predominantly mobile-first internet users

*Export and Sharing Options*

Visualizations support multiple export formats:
