The WardTimeSeriesPopulation entity implements a comprehensive data collection and integration process that addresses Nepal's unique challenges in maintaining consistent population data over time. This process encompasses several critical workflows:

===== Census Data Integration

The primary data source for time series points is Nepal's decennial census, conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics. When census data becomes available (approximately every 10 years), it is integrated as authoritative points in the time series with `isCensusYear=true`. This census data provides the anchor points for all estimates and projections.

Census years are marked with detailed methodology references, including enumeration techniques, sampling approaches (if any), and data quality indicators. This methodological documentation is crucial for interpreting intercensal estimates and understanding data limitations.

===== Intercensal Estimation Process

Between census years, the system employs several estimation techniques to provide reasonable population approximations at the ward level:

1. **Component Method**: Incorporates birth, death, and migration data from civil registration systems where available
2. **Housing Unit Method**: Utilizes changes in housing stock and household size to estimate population changes
3. **Ratio Correlation**: Uses correlations with other indicators (electricity connections, school enrollments, etc.)
4. **Mathematical Models**: Applies geometric or exponential growth models based on past growth patterns

Each intercensal estimate is flagged with `isProjected=true` and includes documentation of the specific estimation technique used, enabling data consumers to understand the methodology and limitations.

===== Administrative Boundary Change Handling

A unique challenge in Nepal's demographic time series is the frequent changes to administrative boundaries, especially following the 2017 federal restructuring. The WardTimeSeriesPopulation entity explicitly tracks these changes with:

1. **Boundary Change Documentation**: Records when ward boundaries change, including the official date and reference decree
2. **Area Allocation Factors**: Calculates what percentage of population should be redistributed when boundaries change
3. **Population Reconciliation**: Adjusts historical time series to maintain comparability across boundary changes
4. **Dual Representation**: Maintains both original and boundary-adjusted population figures for analysis

This boundary change tracking is essential for meaningful time series analysis in Nepal's evolving administrative context, allowing for consistent trend analysis despite changing geographic definitions.

===== Data Quality Assurance

The process includes multiple validation steps to ensure data quality:

1. **Comparisons with Previous Census**: Validating that growth rates fall within plausible ranges
2. **Sex Ratio Validation**: Ensuring gender distributions align with expected demographic patterns
3. **Density Checks**: Validating that population density figures are reasonable for geographic contexts
4. **Cross-verification**: Comparing with other administrative data sources like voter rolls and school enrollments

Each time series point receives a confidence level rating (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, VERY_LOW) to indicate data reliability, with census years typically receiving HIGH confidence and intercensal estimates receiving varying ratings based on methodology and data sources.
