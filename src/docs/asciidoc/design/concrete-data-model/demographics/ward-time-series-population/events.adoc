The diagram above illustrates how events flow through the system when a new ward time series is created. The process demonstrates several key patterns:

1. **Hierarchical Event Propagation**: Events trigger aggregation up the administrative hierarchy, with each level publishing its own events.

2. **Validation Before Publication**: Data is validated before events are published, ensuring data quality.

3. **Anomaly Detection**: Automated checks for unusual patterns trigger separate anomaly events when detected.

4. **Audit Trail**: All events are recorded for audit purposes, maintaining transparency and traceability.

5. **Notification Integration**: Critical events trigger notifications to relevant stakeholders.

==== Event Application Use Cases

===== Updating Resource Allocation After Population Revision

When ward population estimates are revised, the system needs to update resource allocation formulas at multiple levels. The WardTimeSeriesPopulationUpdatedEvent triggers a cascade of recalculations:

1. Municipal fiscal transfer calculations for the affected ward are recalculated
2. District-level service coverage metrics (health, education) are updated
3. Provincial development indices incorporating population are refreshed
4. National statistical publications are flagged for update

This ensures that resource allocation remains aligned with the most current population figures, a critical concern in Nepal's formula-based fiscal federalism system.

===== Boundary Change Reconciliation

When administrative boundaries change (as occurred extensively during Nepal's federal restructuring), historical population data must be recalculated for the new boundaries to maintain consistent time series. The BoundaryChangeAdjustmentCreatedEvent triggers:

1. Recalculation of historical populations under new boundaries
2. Adjustment of growth rates to account for boundary changes
3. Updating of GIS systems with new boundary definitions
4. Notification to planning agencies about changed population bases

This process ensures planning continuity despite administrative reorganization, allowing for consistent trend analysis across boundary changes.

===== Anomaly Investigation Workflow

When the PopulationAnomalyDetectedEvent is triggered, it initiates an investigation workflow:

1. Data verification tasks are created for statistical officers
2. Comparison with adjacent wards is automatically performed
3. Historical patterns are analyzed for context
4. External factors (disasters, development projects) are checked
5. Resolution options are presented (confirm, correct, or explain)

This workflow helps distinguish between data errors and genuine demographic shifts requiring policy responses, ensuring data integrity while capturing real demographic changes.

==== Nepal-Specific Event Considerations

1. **Multi-Calendar Support**: Events include conversion between Bikram Sambat (Nepal's official calendar) and Gregorian dates for international compatibility.

2. **Geographical Context Tags**: Events include metadata about ecological zone (Mountain, Hill, Terai) and remoteness category, essential context for Nepal's diverse geography.

3. **Disaster Correlation**: Events can be tagged with related disaster events, allowing population changes to be analyzed in the context of Nepal's frequent natural disasters.

4. **Political Transition Markers**: Events occurring during significant political transitions (constitution promulgation, local elections) are flagged, as these often correlate with administrative or policy changes affecting demographics.

5. **Development Project Linkage**: Events can be associated with major infrastructure projects that influence population distribution, such as new highways or hydropower projects.

These Nepal-specific considerations ensure that population data events capture the complex geographical, political, and development contexts that shape Nepal's demographic patterns.
