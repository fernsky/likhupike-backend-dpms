The diagram above illustrates how events flow through the system when demographic projections are approved or new scenarios are created. The process demonstrates several key patterns:

1. **Event-Driven Planning Updates**: Domain events trigger updates to planning systems, ensuring that planning decisions are based on the latest demographic projections.

2. **Stakeholder Notification**: Events automatically generate notifications to relevant stakeholders based on the event type and administrative area.

3. **Sectoral Planning Integration**: Specialized planning systems for different sectors (education, healthcare, etc.) receive targeted updates based on projection changes.

4. **Validation Workflows**: Events trigger validation processes that ensure projection quality and consistency.

5. **Spatial Planning Linkage**: Demographic projections directly inform spatial planning through event-based integration.

==== Event Application Use Cases

===== Municipal Development Planning

When a new demographic projection is approved for a municipality:

1. The `DemographicProjectionStatusChangedEvent` is published with newStatus = APPROVED.
2. The Municipal Planning Department is notified of the approved projection.
3. Urban planning systems update their population assumptions for infrastructure sizing.
4. Land use planning tools incorporate the projections for zoning decisions.
5. Municipal service capacity models are updated with new population forecasts.

This process ensures that municipal development planning is based on officially approved demographic projections rather than outdated assumptions or unofficial estimates.

===== Education Infrastructure Planning

When age distribution projections are updated:

1. The `AgeDistributionProjectedEvent` is published with updated school-age population projections.
2. The Education Department's planning system receives this event automatically.
3. School capacity models are updated with new enrollment projections.
4. Teacher allocation systems adjust future staffing requirements.
5. School construction planning tools identify areas needing new facilities.

This event chain enables education infrastructure to anticipate demographic shifts rather than merely reacting to them, preventing both overcrowding and resource waste.

===== Healthcare System Planning

When multiple scenarios for demographic aging are created:

1. The `ProjectionScenarioCreatedEvent` is published for several aging scenarios.
2. The Healthcare Planning Department receives notifications about these scenarios.
3. Healthcare demand models update based on the new elderly population projections.
4. Facility planning tools identify areas needing expanded geriatric services.
5. Healthcare workforce planning adjusts training requirements for elderly care.

This use case demonstrates how scenario-based planning allows healthcare systems to prepare for different possible demographic futures rather than relying on a single projection.

===== Transportation Infrastructure Sizing

When spatial distribution projections are updated:

1. The `SpatialDistributionProjectedEvent` is published with new population density patterns.
2. The Transportation Department's planning systems receive this event.
3. Traffic modeling tools update based on projected population distribution.
4. Road capacity planning adjusts to anticipated demand changes.
5. Public transportation route planning identifies new high-density corridors.

This process ensures that transportation infrastructure planning is directly informed by projected spatial population patterns, supporting more efficient infrastructure investment.

===== Social Service Alignment

When projection impact assessments are completed:

1. The `ProjectionImpactAssessedEvent` is published with social service implications.
2. Social welfare departments receive notifications about projected vulnerability patterns.
3. Social service planning tools adjust resource allocation based on projected needs.
4. Program development focuses on areas with increasing vulnerability projections.
5. Budget planning incorporates long-term demographic-driven service demands.

This event chain ensures that social services anticipate changing demographic needs rather than simply responding to current demands.

==== Integration with Nepal's Planning Ecosystem

The Demographic Projection event system is specifically designed to integrate with Nepal's planning processes:

===== National Planning Commission Integration

1. Key projection events are automatically routed to the National Planning Commission's planning systems.
2. Projections reaching APPROVED status trigger updates to national development planning assumptions.
3. Scenario creation events allow the NPC to consider alternative demographic futures in policy formulation.

===== Provincial Planning Integration

1. Province-specific events are routed to provincial planning departments based on the adminAreaId.
2. Provincial infrastructure planning systems receive spatial distribution events for their jurisdiction.
3. Provincial development budgeting systems receive impact assessment events for resource allocation.

===== Local Government Planning

1. Municipality and ward-level projection events are routed to relevant local government systems.
2. Local development planning tools receive population projections specific to their jurisdiction.
3. Service delivery planning systems update based on local demographic forecasts.

===== Sectoral Planning Integration

1. Age distribution events route to education planning systems for school planning.
2. Elderly population projections trigger updates to healthcare and social security systems.
3. Working-age population projections inform employment and skills development planning.

These integrations ensure that demographic projections flow seamlessly to all levels of Nepal's planning ecosystem, supporting evidence-based decision-making throughout the federal structure.

==== Nepal-Specific Event Types

Several event types are specifically designed for Nepal's demographic planning context:

===== MigrationProjectionEvent

Specialized for Nepal's high international migration context, tracking projections of:
- Foreign labor migration patterns
- Remittance flow projections
- Return migration scenarios
- Migration impact on household structures

===== EarthquakeRecoveryProjectionEvent

Given Nepal's earthquake vulnerability, this event communicates:
- Population return projections for earthquake-affected areas
- Reconstruction-driven population movements
- Long-term displacement patterns
- Vulnerability distribution for future events

===== FederalRestructuringImpactEvent

To address Nepal's ongoing federal transition:
- Administrative center development impacts
- Resource allocation effects on population distribution
- Service access changes driving migration
- New provincial capital development effects

These Nepal-specific events ensure the system addresses the country's unique demographic planning needs, going beyond generic demographic event types.

==== Security and Compliance Considerations

All demographic projection events are subject to:

1. **Access Control**: Events are only delivered to authorized subscribers with appropriate permissions.
2. **Classification Levels**: Projections may be classified (e.g., DRAFT, INTERNAL, PUBLIC) with corresponding restrictions.
3. **Audit Trail**: All projection events are logged for traceability and accountability.
4. **Data Sensitivity**: Certain projection details may be filtered based on sensitivity levels.

These controls ensure that demographic projections, which can have significant policy and planning implications, are shared securely and appropriately.
