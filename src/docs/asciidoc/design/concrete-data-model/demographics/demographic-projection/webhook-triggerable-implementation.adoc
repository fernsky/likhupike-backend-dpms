The DemographicProjection entity leverages the WebhookTriggerable interface to establish a real-time integration system that alerts relevant planning departments, agencies, and information systems when demographic projections are created, updated, approved, or when significant scenario changes occur. This capability ensures that forward-looking demographic insights are immediately available to planning processes across Nepal's government ecosystem.

===== Webhook Event Types

The implementation defines several specialized demographic projection webhook event types:

1. **PROJECTION_CREATED**: Triggered when a new demographic projection is initially created
   - Enables planning systems to track projection development from inception
   - Allows early preparation for forthcoming demographic scenarios

2. **PROJECTION_UPDATED**: Fired when significant changes are made to an existing projection
   - Notifies dependent systems of revised demographic assumptions
   - Enables planning updates when baseline data or methodology changes

3. **PROJECTION_APPROVED**: Triggered when a projection receives official approval
   - Signals that the projection is now suitable for formal planning purposes
   - Initiates official planning processes that depend on validated projections

4. **SCENARIO_CREATED**: Fired when a new scenario is added to a projection
   - Notifies systems of additional demographic futures to consider
   - Enables comparison with existing planning scenarios

5. **SCENARIO_UPDATED**: Triggered when an existing scenario is significantly modified
   - Alerts dependent systems to reassess plans based on revised scenarios
   - Provides details on what specific parameters changed

Each event type has a specialized payload structure optimized for the specific projection context and purpose.

===== Administrative Area Targeting

A sophisticated targeting system ensures webhooks are triggered only for relevant administrative areas:

1. **Hierarchical Subscription**: Planning systems can subscribe to projections for specific administrative levels
   - Example: Provincial planning systems receiving notifications for all district-level projections within their province

2. **Thematic Area Filtering**: Subscriptions can be filtered by projection purpose
   - Example: Education departments receiving only projections relevant to school-age population

3. **Geographic Focus Areas**: Planning systems can designate priority areas for enhanced notification
   - Example: Disaster management systems receiving detailed notifications for high-risk districts

4. **Time Horizon Filtering**: Subscriptions can specify projections with particular time horizons
   - Example: Infrastructure systems focusing on 15+ year projections for major investments

This targeting ensures that planning systems receive relevant projection information without being overwhelmed by updates for areas outside their jurisdiction or focus.
