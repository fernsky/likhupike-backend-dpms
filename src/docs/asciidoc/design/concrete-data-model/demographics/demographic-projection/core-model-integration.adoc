The DemographicProjection entity extends ApprovableEntity from the core domain and implements two key capability interfaces: CustomValidatable and WebhookTriggerable. This integration provides the entity with sophisticated approval workflows, complex validation capabilities, and the ability to trigger notifications to external systems when demographic projections are updated.

===== Inheritance from ApprovableEntity

By extending ApprovableEntity, DemographicProjection inherits several key attributes and behaviors:

1. **Approval Workflow**: Demographic projections go through a formal approval process before they can be used for official planning purposes. This is critical for ensuring the quality and reliability of projections that may influence significant resource allocation decisions.

2. **Approval Metadata**: The entity tracks who approved the projection, when it was approved, and any notes or conditions attached to the approval.

3. **Approval Status Management**: The entity can transition through different approval states, allowing projections to be reviewed and validated before being finalized.

This inheritance is particularly important in Nepal's context, where demographic projections often inform government planning and resource allocation decisions. The approval mechanism ensures proper oversight of potentially impactful projections.

===== CustomValidatable Implementation

DemographicProjection implements the CustomValidatable interface to enable:

1. **Methodological Validation**: Ensuring that the projection follows sound demographic and statistical methodologies.

2. **Assumption Consistency Checks**: Validating that projection assumptions are internally consistent and plausible.

3. **Historical Consistency**: Checking that projections align sensibly with historical demographic trends.

4. **Cross-Variable Consistency**: Ensuring related demographic variables (fertility, mortality, migration) produce coherent outcomes.

This implementation allows the system to enforce custom validation rules specific to demographic projections, such as requiring that age-specific fertility rates sum to the total fertility rate or that mortality assumptions follow established patterns.

===== WebhookTriggerable Implementation

The WebhookTriggerable interface enables DemographicProjection to:

1. **Notify Planning Systems**: Automatically alert planning departments when new demographic projections are approved.

2. **Update Dashboards**: Trigger updates to government dashboards and reporting systems when projections change.

3. **Inform Stakeholders**: Notify relevant ministries and agencies about demographic projections relevant to their areas of responsibility.

4. **Integration with Planning Workflows**: Connect with planning workflow systems to initiate or update planning processes based on new projections.

This capability is essential in Nepal's planning ecosystem, where demographic projections need to be communicated to multiple stakeholders across different levels of government.

===== Composition Relationships

DemographicProjection has several main composition relationships:

1. **ProjectionScenario**: Represents different scenarios (high growth, low growth, policy intervention, etc.) within a projection. These scenarios allow for examining multiple possible demographic futures.

2. **ProjectionPoint**: Contains the detailed demographic data for a specific year within a projection, including population by age, gender, and other characteristics.

3. **ProjectedDemographicIndicator**: Represents derived indicators such as dependency ratios, growth rates, and other demographic metrics for each year in the projection.

4. **ProjectionImpactAssessment**: Assesses the implications of projected demographic changes on different sectors such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.

These relationships enable the detailed documentation of both the demographic projections themselves and their potential implications for planning and policy.

===== Nepal-Specific Implementation Considerations

The implementation of DemographicProjection in Nepal's context includes several specialized adaptations:

1. **Natural Disaster Scenario Capability**: Enhanced support for modeling the demographic impacts of earthquakes, floods, and landslides, which are significant risks in Nepal.

2. **Migration Modeling Focus**: Sophisticated capabilities for modeling international labor migration, which heavily impacts Nepal's demographic structure.

3. **Federalism Transition**: Support for projecting population redistribution due to Nepal's transition to a federal system, which is creating new administrative centers.

4. **Ecological Zone Considerations**: Differentiated projection methodologies for mountain, hill, and terai (plains) regions, which have distinct demographic patterns.

5. **Remittance Economy Factors**: Incorporation of remittance-influenced demographic behaviors, including delayed marriage, reduced fertility, and changed consumption patterns.

These Nepal-specific adaptations ensure that the DemographicProjection entity supports the country's unique demographic context and planning needs, while maintaining alignment with international demographic projection standards.
