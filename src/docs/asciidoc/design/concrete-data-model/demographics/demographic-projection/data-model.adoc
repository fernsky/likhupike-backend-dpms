==== Data Storage Considerations

The DemographicProjection system employs specialized data storage approaches:

1. **Time Series Optimization**: Efficient storage for long projection series, using sparse storage techniques for years where limited change occurs

2. **JSON Data Types**: Extensive use of JSON/JSONB fields for flexible storage of projection parameters and results, balancing structure with adaptability

3. **Array Types**: Use of array types for storage of age distributions and other vector data to minimize normalized table complexity

4. **Materialized Views**: Implementation of materialized views for frequently accessed summary statistics to improve performance

5. **Historical Versioning**: Systematic versioning to maintain complete history of projection updates while optimizing storage

==== Integration Points

The data model maintains several critical integration points with other system components:

1. **Administrative Boundaries**: Integration with the administrative boundary system for proper spatial reference

2. **Baseline Demographics**: Connection to current demographic statistics for baseline values

3. **Planning Systems**: Integration points with education, healthcare, infrastructure and other planning systems that consume projections

4. **GIS Visualization**: Connections to GIS systems for spatial visualization of projections

5. **Document Management**: Links to documentation explaining projection methodologies and assumptions

These integration points ensure that demographic projections are properly contextualized within the broader system and can be effectively used for planning purposes.

==== Data Quality Management

Each projection includes explicit quality indicators:

1. **Confidence Levels**: Explicit assessment of projection reliability

2. **Assumption Documentation**: Comprehensive recording of all assumptions

3. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Documentation of how sensitive results are to key assumptions

4. **Validation History**: Recording of all validation activities

5. **Comparison Against Actuals**: As time passes, projections are automatically compared against actual demographic data for accuracy assessment

These quality management features ensure that users understand the limitations and reliability of projections, critical for appropriate use in planning contexts.
