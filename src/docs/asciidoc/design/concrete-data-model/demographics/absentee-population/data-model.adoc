==== Core Entity Structure

The AbsenteePopulation entity serves as the primary record for absentee population data within a specific administrative area and time period. It extends BaseEntity and implements several capability interfaces.

===== Primary Attributes

|===
| Attribute | Type | Description
| administrativeAreaId | UUID | Reference to the administrative area (ward, municipality, district, province, or national)
| adminLevel | AdministrativeLevel | Level of the administrative area in Nepal's federal structure
| year | Integer | Year of the absentee population data
| quarter | Integer | Quarter (1-4) for quarterly data (nullable)
| referenceDate | Date | Reference date for the absentee statistics
| totalPopulation | Integer | Total official population of the administrative area
| totalAbsentPopulation | Integer | Count of absent population at reference date
| absenteePercentage | Double | Percentage of population that is absent
| methodology | DataCollectionMethodology | Method used to collect the data
| confidenceLevel | ConfidenceLevel | Confidence level in the data accuracy
| methodologyDescription | String | Detailed description of methodology
| isCensusData | Boolean | Whether this is from official census
| dataSource | String | Source organization or system
|===

===== Related Components

The AbsenteePopulation entity uses a composition pattern with several related entities that provide detailed information about different aspects of migration:

1. **MigrationCategory**: Categorizes absentees by type of migration (labor, educational, etc.)
   - Links migration volumes to specific types
   - Allows analysis by migration category across geographies
   - Supports trend analysis for each migration type

2. **DestinationRegion**: Records domestic and international destinations
   - Maps migration corridors from source to destination
   - Supports origin-destination matrix analysis
   - Enables geographic pattern detection in migration flows

3. **MigrationReason**: Documents reasons for migration
   - Captures motivations behind migration decisions
   - Supports causal analysis of migration patterns
   - Enables policy targeting based on migration drivers

4. **ReturneeStatus**: Tracks return migration patterns
   - Documents circular migration cycles
   - Captures permanent versus temporary migration
   - Records duration patterns of absence

5. **HouseholdImpact**: Records impacts on household structure
   - Captures de facto female-headed household creation
   - Tracks children left behind by migrant parents
   - Documents elderly left without caregivers
   - Records completely absent households

6. **ForeignEmploymentRecord**: Detailed information about labor migration
   - Links to official labor migration data
   - Tracks formal versus informal migration channels
   - Records occupational distribution of migrants
   - Estimates economic impact through remittances

7. **EducationalMigrationRecord**: Tracks educational migration
   - Documents student migration patterns
   - Captures educational field distribution
   - Tracks return rates after education completion
   - Supports brain drain/gain analysis

8. **SeasonalMigrationPattern**: Documents seasonal migration cycles
   - Captures cyclical movement patterns
   - Links to agricultural and climate cycles
   - Documents traditional nomadic or semi-nomadic patterns
   - Records economic activities associated with seasonal movement

==== Nepal-Specific Model Features

The AbsenteePopulation data model incorporates several features specific to Nepal's migration context:

1. **Destination Types for Nepal's Migration Corridors**:
   - INTERNAL_SAME_PROVINCE: Migration within the same province
   - INTERNAL_OTHER_PROVINCE: Cross-province migration, particularly to Kathmandu Valley
   - INTERNATIONAL_NEIGHBORING: Migration to India and China, with special emphasis on India due to the open border
   - INTERNATIONAL_GULF: Migration to Gulf Cooperation Council countries, a major destination for Nepali workers
   - INTERNATIONAL_EAST_ASIA: Migration to Malaysia, South Korea, and Japan
   - INTERNATIONAL_EUROPE, NORTH_AMERICA: Emerging destinations with different migration patterns
   
2. **Nepal-Specific Reason Categories**:
   - Includes categories particularly relevant to Nepal's context like disaster displacement (reflecting earthquake and flood impacts)
   - Conflict-induced migration (reflecting Nepal's post-conflict context)
   - Seasonal work (reflecting agricultural cycles in different ecological zones)

3. **Administrative Level Alignment**:
   - Aligns with Nepal's federal structure following the 2015 Constitution
   - Supports tracking at ward, municipality, district, province, and national levels

4. **Seasonal Migration Tracking**:
   - Captures traditional seasonal migration patterns between ecological zones
   - Documents India-Nepal seasonal labor flows
   - Records high-altitude to low-altitude winter migrations
   - Tracks transhumance (seasonal livestock herding migration)

==== Data Quality Management

The AbsenteePopulation entity implements robust data quality management through:

1. **Multiple Confidence Levels**:
   - HIGH: Census data with good coverage
   - MEDIUM: Administrative data or robust surveys
   - LOW: Limited survey or administrative data
   - VERY_LOW: Significant estimation component
   - ESTIMATED: Primarily derived through estimation

2. **Methodology Documentation**:
   - Explicit recording of data collection methodology
   - Detailed description of estimation methods
   - Source organization and method documentation
   - Temporal consistency indicators

3. **Estimation Flagging**:
   - Clear indication of which components are directly measured versus estimated
   - Particular focus on flagging estimates for undocumented migration
   - Transparent handling of India migration estimates, which are often based on indirect methods due to the open border

==== Technical Implementation Considerations

The AbsenteePopulation data model is implemented with several technical considerations:

1. **Temporal Dimensions**:
   - Support for both annual and quarterly data
   - Reference date tracking for point-in-time accuracy
   - Time series compatibility for trend analysis

2. **Statistical Aggregation Support**:
   - Attributes designed to support correct statistical aggregation
   - Clear population denominators for rate calculations
   - Percentage fields pre-calculated for consistent representation

3. **Flexible Categorization**:
   - Extensible enumeration types allowing for addition of new categories
   - Description fields for capturing nuance beyond categorization
   - Support for multi-factor categorization through many-to-many relationships

4. **Integration Hooks**:
   - Designed for synchronization with external systems like the Foreign Employment Board
   - Compatible with international migration databases
   - Support for integration with census data systems

5. **Spatial Analysis Capabilities**:
   - Designed to support GIS integration
   - Structured for migration corridor mapping
   - Compatible with spatial visualization requirements

This comprehensive data model provides the foundation for sophisticated migration analysis, policy planning, and service delivery targeting in Nepal's high-migration context.
