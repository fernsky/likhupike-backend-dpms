The DemographicChangeAnalysis entity extends ApprovableEntity from the core domain and implements two key capability interfaces: CustomValidatable and WebhookTriggerable. This integration provides the entity with sophisticated approval workflows, complex validation capabilities, and the ability to trigger notifications to external systems when significant demographic changes are detected.

===== Inheritance from ApprovableEntity

By extending ApprovableEntity, DemographicChangeAnalysis inherits several key attributes and behaviors:

1. **Approval Workflow**: Demographic analyses go through a formal approval process before they can be published or used for official planning purposes. This is critical for ensuring the quality and reliability of demographic insights.

2. **Approval Metadata**: The entity tracks who approved the analysis, when it was approved, and any notes or conditions attached to the approval.

3. **Approval Status Management**: The entity can transition through different approval states, allowing analyses to be reviewed and validated before being finalized.

This inheritance is particularly important in Nepal's context, where demographic analyses often inform government planning and resource allocation decisions. The approval mechanism ensures proper oversight of potentially sensitive demographic information.

===== CustomValidatable Implementation

DemographicChangeAnalysis implements the CustomValidatable interface to enable:

1. **Methodological Validation**: Ensuring that the demographic analysis follows sound statistical and demographic methodologies.

2. **Data Consistency Checks**: Validating that detected changes are consistent with historical patterns and plausible demographic transitions.

3. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Comparing analysis results with other demographic indicators to check for inconsistencies or anomalies.

4. **Publication Readiness**: Validating that analyses meet all quality criteria before being marked as ready for publication.

This implementation allows the system to enforce custom validation rules specific to demographic analysis, such as requiring that change percentages sum correctly or that detected patterns have sufficient statistical significance.

===== WebhookTriggerable Implementation

The WebhookTriggerable interface enables DemographicChangeAnalysis to:

1. **Notify Planning Systems**: Automatically alert planning departments when significant demographic shifts are detected.

2. **Update Dashboards**: Trigger updates to government dashboards and reporting systems when new analyses are approved.

3. **Inform Stakeholders**: Notify relevant ministries and agencies about demographic changes relevant to their areas of responsibility.

4. **Integration with SDG Monitoring**: Connect with Sustainable Development Goal monitoring systems to update progress tracking when demographic indicators change.

This capability is essential in Nepal's planning ecosystem, where demographic changes need to be communicated to multiple stakeholders across different levels of government and development partners.

===== Composition Relationships

DemographicChangeAnalysis has two main composition relationships:

1. **DemographicChange**: Represents specific changes in demographic measures detected during the analysis. These changes are the core findings of the analysis and may trigger different responses based on their significance and type.

2. **ChangeDetectionRule**: Encapsulates the rules and thresholds used to identify significant demographic changes. These rules can be calibrated based on historical patterns and administrative level.

These relationships enable the detailed documentation of both what changed in the demographic landscape and how those changes were detected, providing transparency and methodological clarity.

===== Nepal-Specific Implementation Considerations

The implementation of DemographicChangeAnalysis in Nepal's context includes several specialized adaptations:

1. **Ecological Zone Awareness**: Change detection rules are calibrated differently for mountain, hill, and terai (plains) regions, recognizing Nepal's diverse geographical contexts.

2. **Migration Impact Focus**: Special consideration of migration effects, reflecting Nepal's high labor outmigration and its impact on demographic structures.

3. **Multi-Level Integration**: Analysis can be performed at different administrative levels (ward, municipality, district, province) in alignment with Nepal's federal structure.

4. **Disaster Impact Analysis**: Enhanced capabilities for analyzing demographic changes following natural disasters, particularly relevant after events like the 2015 earthquake.

5. **Ethnic/Caste Dimension**: Support for analyzing demographic changes by caste and ethnic group, reflecting Nepal's diverse social composition and the importance of inclusion.

These Nepal-specific adaptations ensure that the DemographicChangeAnalysis entity supports the country's unique demographic context and planning needs, while maintaining alignment with international demographic analysis standards.
