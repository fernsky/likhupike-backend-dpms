The DemographicChangeAnalysis entity implements CustomValidatable to enforce rigorous validation rules for demographic change data, ensuring that analyses are methodologically sound, statistically valid, and correctly interpreted.

===== Demographic-Specific Validation Rules

The implementation includes specialized validation rules that address the unique characteristics of demographic change analysis:

*Demographic Balance Equation Validation*

Every demographic change analysis must satisfy fundamental demographic equations:

```
Final Population = Initial Population + Births - Deaths + Immigration - Emigration
```

The validation engine checks these relationships across all demographic measures, ensuring mathematical consistency. For Nepal's context, this includes specialized handling for:

1. **Migration Estimation**: Validating that migration estimates are plausible given Nepal's international mobility patterns
2. **Age-Cohort Progression**: Ensuring that age cohort changes follow logical patterns over time
3. **Component Method Consistency**: Verifying that population changes are consistent with component changes (births, deaths, migration)

*Trend Plausibility Validation*

The system applies demographic knowledge to validate trend plausibility:

1. **Rate of Change Limits**: Ensuring demographic changes fall within historically plausible ranges
   - Example: Fertility rate changes typically don't exceed 0.5 children per woman in a 5-year period

2. **Transition Pattern Conformity**: Validating that changes follow known demographic transition patterns
   - Example: Declining child mortality typically precedes declining fertility

3. **Spatial Consistency**: Checking that geographic patterns of change are consistent with known mobility and development patterns
   - Example: Rural-to-urban migration follows expected corridors based on infrastructure and economic opportunity

4. **Temporal Logic**: Enforcing logical temporal sequences in demographic events
   - Example: Working-age population changes follow youth population changes with appropriate time lag

*Methodological Validation*

The system validates the analytical methodologies used in demographic change analysis:

1. **Appropriate Time Periods**: Ensuring that the time period selected is appropriate for the demographic phenomenon being analyzed
   - Example: Migration analysis requires at least 5-year periods to distinguish trends from noise

2. **Reference Period Selection**: Validating that comparison periods are methodologically sound
   - Example: Comparing census years (2011 vs 2021) rather than mixing census and intercensal estimates

3. **Data Source Compatibility**: Verifying that data sources being compared use compatible definitions and methodologies
   - Example: Ensuring consistent definition of "urban" areas across time periods

4. **Statistical Significance**: Validating that identified changes exceed statistical noise thresholds
   - Example: Ensuring that a 2% change in literacy rate in a small ward is actually significant

===== Nepal-Specific Validation Adaptations

The validation implementation includes several adaptations specific to Nepal's demographic context:

1. **Federal Restructuring Adjustment**: Special validation for analyses spanning Nepal's 2017 federal restructuring, which created new administrative boundaries

2. **Disaster Impact Validation**: Enhanced plausibility checks for areas affected by the 2015 earthquake, which caused significant population displacement

3. **Labor Migration Patterns**: Specialized validation for areas with high international labor migration, accounting for circular migration patterns

4. **Census Methodology Changes**: Validation rules that account for changes in census methodology between 2011 and 2021

5. **Multilingual Demographic Data**: Validation for consistency across data collected in multiple languages, particularly important in Nepal's diverse linguistic landscape

These Nepal-specific validations ensure that demographic change analyses accurately reflect the country's unique demographic dynamics rather than flagging valid patterns as errors based on generic demographic assumptions.

===== Dynamic Validation Registration

The CustomValidatable implementation allows for dynamic registration of specialized validators:

1. **Ecological Zone Validators**: Custom validators for mountain, hill, and terai regions, which have distinct demographic patterns

2. **Ethnic Demographic Validators**: Specialized validators for areas with high concentrations of specific ethnic groups, whose demographic behaviors may differ from national patterns

3. **Border Region Validators**: Custom validation for border areas with India, which have unique cross-border mobility patterns

4. **Urban Tier Validators**: Different validation rules for metropolitan cities, sub-metropolitan cities, municipalities, and rural municipalities

These dynamic validators can be registered at runtime, allowing the system to adapt validation to specific local contexts while maintaining a consistent validation framework.

===== Validation Response Handling

The implementation provides sophisticated handling of validation results:

1. **Tiered Severity Classification**: Validation issues are classified from "Critical" (mathematical impossibilities) to "Advisory" (unusual but possible patterns)

2. **Contextual Recommendations**: Each validation issue includes specific recommendations for resolution, tailored to the type of demographic data

3. **Auto-Correction Suggestions**: Where appropriate, the system suggests specific corrections with statistical justification

4. **Validation History**: Maintains a record of validation attempts, issues, and resolutions for audit purposes

5. **Confidence Level Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts the confidence level of analyses based on validation results

This approach ensures that demographic analyses maintain high quality standards while providing flexibility for Nepal's diverse demographic contexts.

===== Integration with Demographic Change Events

The validation system integrates with the domain event system, publishing validation-related events:

1. **DemographicAnalysisValidatedEvent**: Published when validation completes, regardless of outcome

2. **ValidationFailureEvent**: Triggered when critical validation issues are identified

3. **AnomalyDetectedEvent**: Published when unusual but valid demographic patterns are detected

4. **MethodologicalWarningEvent**: Triggered when methodological concerns are identified

These events allow other system components to respond appropriately to validation results, such as flagging analyses for human review or adjusting confidence levels in dependent calculations.

===== Real-World Example: Migration Impact Validation

When validating a demographic analysis of migration impact in Dhading district:

1. The system checks whether the reported decline in working-age males (-18% over 5 years) is demographically plausible

2. The validation engine compares this decline against:
   - Historical migration patterns in similar hill districts
   - Labor migration statistics from the Department of Foreign Employment
   - Age-sex pyramid changes in comparable districts

3. The system validates that the decline is consistent with:
   - Known destination countries for Nepali migrants
   - Remittance data trends for the district
   - Changes in household composition within the district

4. Upon validation confirmation, the system adds a "High Migration Impact" tag and adjusts service planning recommendations accordingly

This real-world example demonstrates how the CustomValidatable implementation ensures that demographic analyses accurately capture Nepal's complex migration dynamics while maintaining data integrity.
