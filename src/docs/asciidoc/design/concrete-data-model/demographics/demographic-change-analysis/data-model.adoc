==== Data Storage Considerations

The DemographicChangeAnalysis system employs several specialized data storage approaches:

1. **Time Series Storage**: Demographic change data is stored in time series format to enable efficient temporal analysis, using both relational and specialized time series storage.

2. **JSON Document Storage**: Complex analysis results are stored in JSON format within the `analysisResults` field, allowing for flexible representation of diverse analytical outputs.

3. **Geometric Data**: Spatial patterns of demographic change are stored using PostgreSQL's PostGIS extension, enabling spatial analysis of demographic phenomena.

4. **Versioned Storage**: Historical versions of analyses are maintained to track how understanding of demographic patterns evolves over time.

5. **Hierarchical Aggregation**: Results are stored at different administrative levels with links to enable drill-down and roll-up analysis.

==== Data Privacy Considerations

The demographic change analysis system implements several privacy protections:

1. **Aggregation Level Controls**: Ensures that data aggregation levels prevent individual identification, with minimum population thresholds for each analysis level.

2. **Sensitive Attribute Protection**: Special handling for sensitive demographic attributes like ethnicity, religion, and economic status.

3. **Differential Privacy**: Implementation of differential privacy techniques when analyzing small populations.

4. **Analysis Purpose Limitation**: Documentation and enforcement of analysis purpose in alignment with Nepal's data protection principles.

5. **Access Controls**: Tiered access based on administrative level, analysis status, and user role.

These privacy measures ensure that demographic analysis provides valuable planning insights while protecting the privacy rights of Nepal's citizens.
