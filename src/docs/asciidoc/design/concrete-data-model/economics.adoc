=== Economics Domain Model

This section details the concrete implementation of the Economics Domain, building upon the core domain models.

==== Domain Overview

The Economics Domain represents economic activities, income sources, employment patterns, and related financial insights within the Digital Profile system. It implements a comprehensive model of economic entities that directly leverages the core domain models.

==== Core Domain Model Integration

The Economics Domain demonstrates a comprehensive implementation of the core domain models through:

===== Inheritance

Each economic entity extends appropriate base classes:

|===
| Entity | Extends | Purpose
| EconomicSummary | SpatialEntity | Geographic representation with spatial attributes
| EconomicallyActivePopulation | BaseEntity | Economically active population data by demographics
| OccupationDistribution | BaseEntity | Occupation distribution data for an area
| HouseholdChoresStatistics | BaseEntity | Time spent on household chores
| HouseholdIncomeSource | BaseEntity | Sources of household income
| RemittanceExpenseStatistics | BaseEntity | How remittances are used
| IncomeBasedSustenance | BaseEntity | Months household can sustain on income
| LoanUseStatistics | BaseEntity | Purposes for which loans are taken
| TrainedPopulationStatistics | BaseEntity | Population with specialized skills
| SkillsDistribution | BaseEntity | Distribution of specific skills
| ProductsTradeStatistics | BaseEntity | Imported and exported products
| LandPossessionStatistics | BaseEntity | Land ownership statistics
|===

===== Capabilities

Economic entities implement interfaces based on their specific needs:

|===
| Entity | Implements | Capability
| EconomicSummary | HistoryViewable | Tracks economic changes over time
| | AccessControlled | Manages summary-level permissions
| | DataAggregatable | Supports aggregation across geographies
| | FullTextSearchable | Enables advanced search capabilities
| EconomicallyActivePopulation | DataAggregatable | Allows aggregation across demographics
| OccupationDistribution | DataAggregatable | Enables occupation pattern analysis
| HouseholdIncomeSource | HistoryViewable | Tracks changes in income sources
| RemittanceExpenseStatistics | HistoryViewable | Monitors remittance usage patterns
| SkillsDistribution | DataAggregatable | Aggregates skill availability
| ProductsTradeStatistics | ExternalSystemSyncable | Integrates with trade databases
| LandPossessionStatistics | DataAggregatable | Enables land distribution analysis
|===

===== Components

The Economics Domain utilizes reusable components from the core domain:

|===
| Component | Used By | Purpose
| VersionInfo | All Economic Entities | Versioning of economic data
| StatusHistory | EconomicSummary | Status tracking of economic data
| TaggableEntity | EconomicSummary | Categorization capabilities
| MonetaryAmount | HouseholdIncomeSource | Income and economic value representation
| SEOAttributes | Public Economic Information | Search optimization
