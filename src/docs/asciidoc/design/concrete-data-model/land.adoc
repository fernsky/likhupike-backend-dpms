=== Land Domain Model

This section details the concrete implementation of the Land Domain, building upon the core domain models.

==== Domain Overview

The Land Domain represents land parcels, ownership, rights, and usage within the Digital Profile system. It implements a comprehensive model of land-related entities that directly leverages the core domain models.

==== Core Domain Model Integration

The Land Domain demonstrates a comprehensive implementation of the core domain models through:

===== Inheritance

Each land entity extends appropriate base classes:

|===
| Entity | Extends | Purpose
| LandParcel | SpatialEntity | Geographic representation with spatial attributes
| LandBoundary | SpatialEntity | Geographic boundary with spatial capabilities
| LandFeature | SpatialEntity | Features with spatial representation
| LandRights | ApprovableEntity | Rights with approval workflow
| LandOwnership | ApprovableEntity | Ownership records with approval workflow
| LandTransaction | ApprovableEntity, WorkflowEntity | Transactions with approval and workflow capabilities
| LandZoning | NamedEntity | Named zoning classifications
| LandSurvey | ApprovableEntity | Survey records with approval workflow
| LandDispute | ApprovableEntity, WorkflowEntity | Dispute records with approval and workflow capabilities
| LandUse | ReferenceDataEntity | Reference data for land usage types
|===

===== Capabilities

Land entities implement interfaces based on their specific needs:

|===
| Entity | Implements | Capability
| LandParcel | HistoryViewable | Tracks parcel changes over time
| | AccessControlled | Manages parcel-level permissions
| | ExternalSystemSyncable | Synchronizes with cadastral systems
| | GeocodingCapable | Resolves addresses to parcels
| | Taggable | Supports categorization and filtering
| | FullTextSearchable | Enables advanced search capabilities

| | AccessControlled | Manages rights-level permissions
| | CustomValidatable | Ensures complex validation rules
| LandDispute | HistoryViewable | Tracks dispute changes over time
| | WorkflowEntity | Supports complex dispute resolution workflows
|===

===== Components

The Land Domain utilizes reusable components from the core domain:

|===
| Component | Used By | Purpose
| AddressComponent | LandParcel | Physical address representation
| ContactInformation | LandOwnership | Owner contact details
| TaggableEntity | LandParcel, LandZoning | Categorization capabilities
| VersioningStrategy | LandSurvey | Versioning of survey data
| EntityAuditEvent | All Land Entities | Comprehensive audit trail
| OperationalHours | LandRegistry Offices | Office hour representation
| SEOAttributes | Public Land Information | Search optimization

*Real-World Scenario:* 
Farmer Ramesh purchases agricultural land in Rupandehi district and visits the local land registry office. The officer captures the parcel boundary using GPS, creates a LandParcel entity, sets the type as AGRICULTURAL_LAND, creates a LandOwnership entity linking Ramesh to the parcel, and issues a registration certificate. The system automatically synchronizes this data with the national cadastral database.

===== Land Subdivision

*Context:* A landowner wants to subdivide their land parcel into multiple smaller parcels.

*Real-World Scenario:*
Maya owns a 2000 sq.m. residential plot in Kathmandu and decides to subdivide it into three parcels to give to her children. The land registry officer creates a subdivision survey, verifies it meets the municipal minimum plot size requirements, creates three new LandParcel entities (each around 650 sq.m. with separate access roads), updates the status of Maya's original parcel, and issues three new ownership certificates. The system automatically recalculates property taxes for each new parcel.

===== Land Rights Registration

*Context:* A landowner wants to register a specific right (like water usage rights) on their property.

*Real-World Scenario:*
Farmer Krishna owns land adjacent to a river and applies for water extraction rights for irrigation. The officer verifies Krishna's ownership, creates a LandRights entity with type WATER_RIGHT, defines conditions (maximum extraction volumes by season), sets a 5-year duration, and records supporting environmental assessment documents. The system automatically notifies downstream landowners of the new water rights application, allowing them to view details and potentially file objections within a 30-day period.

===== Land Dispute Resolution

*Context:* Two landowners have a boundary dispute that needs resolution.

@startuml
actor "Landowner A" as OwnerA
actor "Landowner B" as OwnerB
participant "Dispute\nOfficer" as Officer
participant "LandDispute" as Dispute

*Real-World Scenario:*
Ram and Shyam have adjacent farms in Chitwan and disagree about their shared boundary, with both claiming a 2-meter strip along their property line. Ram files a LandDispute record with type BOUNDARY, attaching his original deed. The officer notifies Shyam, who submits his own documentation. A surveyor conducts field measurements and creates a LandSurvey showing the historical boundary markers don't match either owner's claim. During mediation, they agree to split the disputed strip equally. The system updates both LandParcel boundaries, issues updated certificates, and closes the dispute with status RESOLVED.

===== Land Transaction (Sale)

*Context:* A landowner is selling their property to a buyer.

*Real-World Scenario:*
Sarita is selling her apartment in Pokhara to Binod for NPR 5,000,000. They visit the land registry office where the officer verifies there are no liens on the property. A LandTransaction with type SALE is created, linking both parties and the LandParcel. The system calculates a 2.5% transfer tax (NPR 125,000) and registration fees. After payment, the officer updates the LandOwnership record, transferring ownership from Sarita to Binod. The system automatically notifies the municipality of the ownership change for property tax purposes and triggers a WebhookTriggerable event to update banking systems about the property's new value for mortgage purposes.

===== Land Zoning Changes

*Context:* A municipality is updating zoning regulations affecting multiple land parcels.

[plantuml]

@startuml
actor "Municipal\nPlanner" as Planner
participant "Planning\nCommission" as Commission
participant "LandZoning" as Zoning
participant "LandParcel" as Parcels
participant "GIS\nService" as GIS
participant "Notification\nService" as Notify

*Real-World Scenario:*
The Bharatpur Municipality planning department is rezoning an area from agricultural to residential-commercial mixed use to accommodate urban growth. The planner creates a new LandZoning entity, defining development standards like maximum building height (4 stories), floor area ratio (1.5), and permitted uses. After public hearings and approval, the GIS service identifies 84 affected LandParcel entities and updates their zoning references. The system automatically notifies all landowners of the zoning change through SMS and email. Property developers can now search for FullTextSearchable parcels in this newly zoned area for potential development opportunities.

===== Land Surveying for Government Project

*Context:* A government infrastructure project requires surveying multiple land parcels.

@startuml
actor "Government\nAgency" as Govt
participant "Survey\nDepartment" as SurveyDept
participant "LandSurvey" as Survey
participant "LandParcel" as Parcels
participant "LandOwnership" as Ownership
participant "BatchProcessing\nService" as Batch

Govt -> SurveyDept : Request infrastructure corridor survey
SurveyDept -> Batch : Initialize batch survey process
activate Batch
Batch -> Parcels : Identify affected parcels in corridor
Batch -> Ownership : Retrieve ownership information
Batch <-- Ownership : Return owners list

SurveyDept <-- Survey : Return completed surveys
deactivate Survey
SurveyDept -> Parcels : Update parcel boundaries if needed
SurveyDept -> Govt : Provide comprehensive survey report
@enduml

*Real-World Scenario:*
The Department of Roads is planning a new highway from Kathmandu to Hetauda. The Survey Department uses the BatchProcessable interface to identify 450 LandParcel entities along the proposed route. For each parcel, they create a LandSurvey record using high-precision GPS equipment, documenting the exact portion needed for the highway. The system automatically calculates the affected area of each parcel and generates a comprehensive report of all landowners who will need compensation. This data becomes the foundation for the land acquisition process, with each LandParcel then having a partial LandTransaction for government acquisition.

==== Common Patterns

===== Entity Lifecycle

Land entities follow consistent lifecycle patterns based on their purpose:

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
' Land Parcel Lifecycle
state "LandParcel Lifecycle" as LPL {
  [*] --> Registered : register
  Registered --> UnderTransaction : sell/transfer
  UnderTransaction --> Registered : complete transaction
  Registered --> Subdivided : subdivide
  Registered --> Merged : merge
  Subdivided --> [*] : new parcels created
  Merged --> [*] : new parcel created
}

' Land Rights Lifecycle
state "LandRights Lifecycle" as LRL {
  [*] --> Draft : create
  Draft --> Pending : submit
  Pending --> Approved : approve
  Pending --> Rejected : reject
  Rejected --> Draft : revise
  Approved --> Active : activate
  Active --> Suspended : suspend
  Active --> Terminated : terminate
  Suspended --> Active : reinstate
  Terminated --> [*]
}

' Land Transaction Lifecycle
state "LandTransaction Lifecycle" as LTL {
  [*] --> Initiated : initiate
  Initiated --> DocumentsSubmitted : submit documents
  DocumentsSubmitted --> UnderReview : review
  UnderReview --> DocumentsRequested : request more documents
  DocumentsRequested --> DocumentsSubmitted : provide documents
  UnderReview --> Approved : approve
  UnderReview --> Rejected : reject
  Approved --> Registered : register
  Registered --> Completed : complete
  Completed --> [*]
}

===== Spatial Data Management

Land entities utilize spatial capabilities for boundary management:

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
participant "LandParcel\nextends SpatialEntity" as LP
participant "LandBoundary" as LB
participant "GISService" as GIS
participant "SpatialCalculator" as Calc

LP -> LB : getBoundary()
activate LB
LP <-- LB : boundary
deactivate LB

LP -> GIS : validateGeometry(boundary)
activate GIS
LP <-- GIS : validationResult
deactivate GIS

LP -> Calc : calculateArea(boundary)
activate Calc
LP <-- Calc : areaInSquareMeters
deactivate Calc

LP -> LP : updateSpatialAttributes()
activate LP
LP -> LP : setArea(areaInSquareMeters)
LP -> Calc : calculatePerimeter(boundary)
activate Calc
LP <-- Calc : perimeterInMeters
deactivate Calc
LP -> LP : setPerimeter(perimeterInMeters)
LP -> Calc : calculateCentroid(boundary)
activate Calc
LP <-- Calc : centroid
deactivate Calc
LP -> LP : setCentroid(centroid)
LP <-- LP
deactivate LP
@enduml
----

===== Approval Workflows

Land transactions follow standardized approval workflows from the core:

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
participant "LandRegistryService" as Service
participant "LandTransaction\nextends ApprovableEntity" as Transaction
participant "Workflow" as Workflow
participant "DomainEventPublisher" as Events

Service -> Transaction : submitForApproval()
activate Transaction
Transaction -> Transaction : setReviewState(PENDING)
Transaction -> Workflow : startApprovalProcess()
activate Workflow
Transaction <-- Workflow : workflowInstanceId
deactivate Workflow
Service <-- Transaction
deactivate Transaction

Service -> Transaction : approve()
activate Transaction
Transaction -> Transaction : validateApprovalRequirements()
Transaction -> Transaction : setReviewState(APPROVED)
Transaction -> Transaction : setIsApproved(true)
Transaction -> Transaction : setApprovedBy(currentUser)
Transaction -> Transaction : setApprovedAt(now())
Transaction -> Events : publish(LandTransactionApprovedEvent)
Service <-- Transaction
deactivate Transaction
