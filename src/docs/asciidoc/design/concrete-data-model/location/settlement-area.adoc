===== Settlement Creation Process

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
|Ward Administrator|
start
:Identify distinct settlement;
:Map settlement boundary;
:Estimate population;

|System|
:Validate settlement data;
:Check boundary within ward;
if (Valid?) then (yes)
  :Create SettlementArea entity
  extending NamedEntity
  and SpatialEntity;
else (no)
  :Return validation errors;
  stop
endif

|Ward Administrator|
:Document cultural context;
:Record infrastructure details;
:Define economic activities;

|System|
:Calculate infrastructure score;
:Update spatial relationships;
:Enable in addressing system;
:Update ward settlement list;
:Publish SettlementAreaCreatedEvent;

|Statistics System|
:Update demographic statistics;
:Recalculate coverage metrics;
:Update development indicators;
