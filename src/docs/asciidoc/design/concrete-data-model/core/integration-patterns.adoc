==== Integration Patterns

===== Component Integration Strategy

The Digital Profile Information System follows these integration patterns:

1. *Core Entity Inheritance Hierarchy* - A clear entity inheritance structure starting with BaseEntity
2. *Capability Interfaces* - Domain capabilities implemented via interfaces for composition over inheritance
3. *Value Objects and Embeddables* - Reusable components that can be embedded in multiple entities
4. *Cross-Cutting Concerns* - Domain-wide structures for auditing, versioning, events, and access control
5. *Domain Events* - Event-driven communication between bounded contexts

===== Composition over Inheritance

Entities combine base classes with capability interfaces:

[source,kotlin]
----
// Example of composition pattern
class CitizenProfile : 
    NamedEntity(),                // Base structure 
    SoftDeletableEntity(),        // Deletion capability
    EncryptedEntity(),            // Security capability
    BiometricVerifiable,          // Verification capability 
    MobileAccessible,             // Mobile access capability
    ComplianceAuditable {         // Compliance capability
    
    // Embedded components
    var address: AddressComponent? = null
    var contactInfo: ContactInformation? = null
    
    // Entity-specific fields
    var citizenId: String? = null
    var dateOfBirth: LocalDate? = null
    
    // Implementation of capability interfaces
    override fun getBiometricVerificationTypes(): Set<BiometricType> { ... }
    override fun getMobileViewConfiguration(): MobileViewConfig { ... }
    // Other implementations...
}
----

===== Bounded Contexts and Aggregates

The system is divided into bounded contexts with clear aggregate roots:

* *Citizen Context* - CitizenProfile as aggregate root
* *Land Context* - LandParcel as aggregate root
* *Document Context* - Document as aggregate root
* *Organization Context* - Organization as aggregate root

===== Cross-Context Integration

Contexts integrate through:

1. *Domain Events* - Loosely coupled communication
2. *Shared Kernel* - Common core models (this document)
3. *Context Maps* - Explicit relationships between contexts

===== Domain Event Flow

@startuml
!define RECTANGLE class

RECTANGLE "Citizen Profile Created" as CPC
RECTANGLE "Document Uploaded" as DU
RECTANGLE "Verification Requested" as VR
RECTANGLE "Verification Completed" as VC
RECTANGLE "Profile Approved" as PA

CPC --> DU : triggers
DU --> VR : may trigger
VR --> VC : followed by
VC --> PA : may lead to

===== Entity Lifecycle Management

The following diagram demonstrates the lifecycle of managed entities:

@startuml
[*] --> Created : create()
Created --> InReview : submit()
InReview --> NeedsChanges : requestChanges()
InReview --> Approved : approve()
NeedsChanges --> InReview : resubmit()
Approved --> Published : publish()
Published --> Unpublished : unpublish()
Approved --> InReview : revise()
Unpublished --> [*] : delete()
Published --> [*] : delete()

===== Cross-Entity Validations

Entities can participate in cross-entity validation rules:

[source,kotlin]
----
// Cross-entity validation example
class ValidationService {
    fun validateCitizenWithProperty(citizen: CitizenProfile, property: LandParcel): ValidationResult {
        // Complex validation rules spanning entities
        val addressMatches = citizen.address?.municipalityCode == property.municipalityCode
        val ageValid = citizen.calculateAge() >= 18
        val ownershipProofValid = verifyDocuments(citizen, property)
        
        // Return comprehensive validation result
        return ValidationResult(
            isValid = addressMatches && ageValid && ownershipProofValid,
            violations = buildViolationsList(addressMatches, ageValid, ownershipProofValid)
        )
    }
}
----

===== Query Optimization Strategies

The domain model supports efficient querying through:

1. *Denormalized Fields* - Pre-computed fields for frequent queries
2. *Caching Strategies* - Time and version-based cache invalidation
3. *Materialized Views* - For complex reporting needs
4. *Search Indexes* - For full-text search capabilities

[source,kotlin]
----
// Query optimization example
interface EntityRepository<T : BaseEntity> {
    // Standard queries
    fun findById(id: UUID): T?
    
    // Optimized for read-heavy operations
    fun findByIdCached(id: UUID): T?
    
    // Specialized search methods
    fun search(query: String, filters: Map<String, Any>): List<T>
    
    // Denormalized aggregates
    fun getStatisticsSummary(): StatisticsSummary
}
----

===== Integration with External Systems

The domain model establishes patterns for external integration:

1. *Adapters* - Convert between internal and external models
2. *Synchronization* - Bidirectional sync with external systems
3. *Webhooks* - Event notifications to external systems
4. *Import/Export* - Standardized data exchange formats

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
actor User
component "Digital Profile System" as DPS
database "Internal DB" as DB
cloud "External Systems" as ES
cloud "Mobile Apps" as MA

User --> DPS
DPS <--> DB
DPS <--> ES : APIs, Webhooks, \nETL Processes
DPS <--> MA : Mobile API, \nOffline Sync

===== Domain Security Integration

Security is integrated throughout the domain model:

1. *Entity-Level Encryption* - Via EncryptedEntity base class
2. *Field-Level Encryption* - For sensitive fields
3. *Access Control* - Via AccessControlled interface
4. *Biometric Verification* - Via BiometricVerifiable interface
5. *Audit Trails* - Comprehensive action logging
6. *Data Classification* - Security levels for data

===== Version Control and Change Management

The domain incorporates enterprise-grade version control:

1. *Entity Versions* - Complete version history
2. *Change Tracking* - Field-level change detection
3. *Approval Workflows* - Multi-level review processes
4. *Conflict Resolution* - Strategies for concurrent modifications

===== Data Governance Integration

The domain model supports data governance through:

1. *Data Retention Policies* - Lifecycle management
2. *Compliance Frameworks* - Regulatory requirements tracking
3. *Data Lineage* - Origin and transformation tracking
4. *Quality Metrics* - Data quality measurement

===== Scalability Patterns

The domain model implements patterns for horizontal scaling:

1. *Tenant Isolation* - Via TenantAware interface
2. *Sharding Support* - Entity design compatible with data sharding
3. *Eventual Consistency* - Event-based synchronization
4. *CQRS* - Separation of read and write models
