==== Embedded Components

Embedded components are reusable value objects used throughout the system to represent common concepts. Unlike entities, they don't have their own identity and are embedded within entities.

These components enforce consistency and reusability across the system by standardizing common data structures that would otherwise be duplicated across multiple entities.
