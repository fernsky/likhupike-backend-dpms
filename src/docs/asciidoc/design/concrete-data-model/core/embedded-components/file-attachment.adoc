*Implementation Details:*
The FileAttachment component in Nepal's Digital Profile system is designed to manage the critical document needs of Nepal's land administration system, with particular attention to the country's document retention requirements, verification processes, and multi-language support.

In this scenario, a land owner (Prakash Rai) is submitting his land ownership certificate (commonly known as "Lalpurja" in Nepal) to a land registry office in Jhapa district. The FileAttachment component handles this process with several Nepal-specific considerations.

When the land registry clerk (Krishna Sharma) receives the physical document, he creates a digital record and uploads a scanned version. The system generates a unique filename following Nepal's government document naming conventions while preserving the original filename that typically includes references to the local term "lalpurja" and the owner's name.

The security scanning process reflects Nepal's increasing focus on digital security in government systems, particularly for sensitive property documents that have historically been targets for fraud. The document undergoes virus scanning before being accepted into the system—an important safeguard as Nepal's digital infrastructure develops.

The OCR processing is particularly valuable in the Nepali context, as it can extract and index key information from the document, including the plot number and area measurements in Nepal's traditional land measurement units (Bigha-Kattha-Dhur-Dhurki in the Terai region). This extraction makes searching and verification more efficient across Nepal's vast land records.

The retention period is set to 100 years (36,500 days), reflecting Nepal's legal requirement for extremely long-term preservation of land records, which must often be referenced across multiple generations of ownership. This long retention period acknowledges the permanent nature of land records in Nepal's legal framework.

The verification process by an authorized officer (Sarita Thapa) reflects Nepal's traditional bureaucratic requirement for official endorsement of documents. The system records exactly who verified the document and when, maintaining the chain of accountability that is central to Nepal's administrative processes.

When the owner requests a document copy, the system generates a temporary, secure link rather than providing unrestricted access to the document. This security measure addresses concerns about unauthorized modifications to land documents—a significant issue in Nepal's land administration history.

The document versioning capabilities come into play during the annual record review, when boundary information is updated. The system maintains a complete history of the document, preserving all versions while clearly marking the current authoritative version. This versioning is crucial in Nepal's land administration context, where historical records may be needed to resolve disputes that can span decades.

The system's notification capabilities ensure that the landowner is informed of document uploads, verifications, and updates—supporting Nepal's push for increased transparency in governance and land administration.

This implementation acknowledges Nepal's paper-heavy administrative heritage while facilitating the transition to digital records management, with careful attention to the security, longevity, and legal requirements specific to land documents in the Nepali context.
