*Implementation Details:*
The AddressComponent in Nepal's Digital Profile system is specifically designed to handle the unique addressing challenges in Nepal, where formal street names and house numbers are often absent, particularly in rural areas.

In this scenario, Maya Tamang is registering her property in Ramechhap Municipality, located in the hilly region of Bagmati Province. The municipal clerk Ramesh creates a new address record for her property, which lacks a formal house number but is located on "Bagar Road" in Ward 4 of Ramechhap Municipality.

The system implements Nepal's administrative hierarchy by capturing not just the address components but also references to the Municipality, District, and Province entities. This hierarchical referencing allows the system to generate properly formatted addresses according to Nepal's standards, which typically follow the pattern: "Street (if available), Ward-Number, Municipality, District, Province."

The AddressComponent enforces this structure by validating that the ward number exists within the specified municipality, and that the municipality exists within the district. This validation is crucial in Nepal's context, where administrative boundaries have been redrawn multiple times during federalization reforms.

The address is created in both Latin script and Devanagari (for Nepali language), supporting Nepal's bilingual government communications. The Devanagari version is particularly important as many citizens, especially in rural areas like Ramechhap, are more familiar with documents in Nepali script.

A unique feature of the Nepal implementation is the inclusion of nearby landmarks ("Near Ganesh Temple") which is essential for navigation in areas lacking formal addressing systems. This field is considered mandatory for rural addresses in the validation rules.

The address verification process reflects Nepal's current practices where a local ward officer physically visits the location to confirm details. Once verified, the address gains official status and can be used for government services, property registration, and utility connections. The verification includes attaching GPS coordinates to the address, gradually building a spatial database of verified locations across Nepal.

This implementation bridges the gap between traditional Nepali addressing practices and the need for standardized digital representation, enabling consistent addressing across government systems while accommodating local realities.
