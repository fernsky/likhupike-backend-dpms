*Implementation Details:*
The GeoLocation component in Nepal's Digital Profile system is specifically designed to address the challenges of capturing accurate geographic coordinates in a country with extreme variations in elevation, from 60 meters in the southern plains to over 8,000 meters in the Himalayan region.

In this scenario, Mingma Sherpa, a Survey Engineer with the Department of Survey, is mapping the exact location of a health post in Khumjung village in the Everest region. This remote health facility serves several mountain communities and accurate coordinates are essential for health service planning, emergency response, and medical supply logistics.

The GeoLocation component captures not just basic latitude and longitude, but comprehensive information needed in Nepal's challenging terrain: altitude data is critical in mountainous regions where vertical distance significantly impacts access times; accuracy measurements are recorded separately for horizontal and vertical dimensions, acknowledging that altitude measurements are typically less accurate than horizontal ones in mountainous terrain.

The system supports multiple coordinate systems used in Nepal. While WGS84 (the GPS standard) is captured initially, the coordinates are converted to Nepal Modified UTM, the official system used by Nepal's Survey Department for government records. This conversion is essential for integration with Nepal's official mapping data.

Given Nepal's rugged terrain, the GeoLocation component includes metadata about the surrounding environment that affects coordinate accuracy and physical accessibility. In this case, surrounding peaks are noted as obstructions that may affect both GPS signal quality and helicopter access routes for medical emergencies.

The verification process reflects Nepal's administrative requirements, where survey data must be certified by an authorized official before being used in official records. The component tracks who verified the coordinates and when.

Once verified, the health facility's GeoLocation data becomes critical for multiple systems: the Health Facility Registry uses it to calculate accessibility metrics vital for resource allocation; the Emergency Response System uses it to plan helicopter evacuation routes and identify suitable landing zones in the mountainous terrain; the District Health Office uses it to plan porter routes for delivering medical supplies during seasons when road access is impossible.

This implementation acknowledges Nepal's realities where GPS accuracy varies dramatically by region, where multiple coordinate systems must be supported for different government departments, and where location information must include elevation data to be meaningful for planning and operations in mountainous areas.
