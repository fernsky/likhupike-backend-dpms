*Implementation Details:*
The ContactInformation component in Nepal's Digital Profile system is designed to handle the unique communication needs of government offices and citizens, accommodating both modern and traditional contact methods while ensuring verification and security.

In this scenario, Suman Gurung, an Administrative Officer at the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP), is setting up the contact information for the Immunization Department. This reflects the common practice in Nepal's government where each department within a ministry has its own contact points for specific services.

The system captures multiple contact methods - reflecting Nepal's communication landscape where landlines, mobile phones, email, fax, and increasingly social media are all used for official communication. Importantly, fax numbers are still maintained for many government offices, particularly for formal communication between departments.

The ContactInformation component implements verification workflows for each contact method. When Program Officer Anita Sharma updates the department's contact information with her direct mobile number and email, the system initiates a verification process. Email verification receives special handling for government domains (like mohp.gov.np), with expedited delivery and prioritization to ensure government communications aren't delayed.

The component distinguishes between verified and unverified contact methods - critical in Nepal's context where official communications must use verified channels. This verification status is tracked with timestamps and attempt counts to prevent verification abuse.

A key feature for Nepal's context is the ability to mark contact information as public or private. Public information appears on government websites and publications, while private contact details are only visible within the government system. This separation helps officials manage the high volume of public inquiries while maintaining internal communication channels.

The ContactInformation component also supports Nepal's growing use of social media for government communication, storing handles for platforms like Facebook and Twitter that ministries increasingly use for public outreach.

For rural areas with limited internet connectivity, the system prioritizes SMS notifications by tracking whether each contact method has notifications enabled. This allows citizens to receive important updates via text message when email isn't practical.

The implementation balances the need for multiple contact points with verification and security, while accommodating Nepal's diverse communication infrastructure that spans from traditional government office landlines to modern digital channels.
