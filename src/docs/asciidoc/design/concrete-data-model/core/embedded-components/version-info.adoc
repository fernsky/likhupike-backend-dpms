*Implementation Details:*
The VersionInfo component in Nepal's Digital Profile system manages document versioning with careful attention to governmental approval workflows and the multi-tiered decision-making processes characteristic of Nepal's bureaucracy.

In this scenario, the Land Management Ministry is developing and maintaining "Land Registration Guidelines," a policy document that standardizes land registration procedures across Nepal. This type of policy document undergoes meticulous version control as it passes through multiple levels of government review and approval.

The system initializes the document with semantic versioning (1.0.0), which aligns with Nepal's documentation practices for policy documents. The VersionInfo component tracks not just version numbers but also approval status—critical in Nepal's governance context where policies require formal approval at multiple levels before implementation.

When policy analyst Ramesh Basnet creates a revision six months later to simplify the registration process, the VersionInfo component increments to version 1.1.0, indicating a minor change that adds functionality without breaking existing processes. The component stores precisely which sections were modified ("content.section3") and maintains a link to the previous version, creating an auditable chain of policy evolution.

The Department Head, Dr. Kavita Rana, uses the VersionInfo's diff capabilities to compare the original published version (1.0.0) with the proposed revision (1.1.0). This comparison highlights specific changes, allowing for targeted review—essential for busy government officials who must efficiently review policy changes.

When Dr. Rana requests clarification on the appeals process, Ramesh makes these changes, and the VersionInfo component increments to version 1.1.1, indicating a patch-level change that doesn't add new functionality but clarifies existing content. This level of detail in version tracking is particularly valuable in Nepal's legal context, where the precise wording of administrative procedures can have significant implications for citizens' rights.

The approval workflow is carefully tracked in the VersionInfo component, capturing who approved each version and when. This creates accountability in the policy development process, with a clear record of which officials endorsed specific versions—an important governance consideration in Nepal's public administration.

When Ministry Secretary Bishnu Paudel conducts the final review, he can see a comprehensive history of the document's evolution, who made which changes, and who has already approved them. This transparency supports Nepal's bureaucratic hierarchy while preventing unauthorized changes to important policy documents.

The VersionInfo component ensures that only one version is marked as current (`isCurrent=true`), maintaining clarity about which version is authoritative—critical for land administration where officials across Nepal's 77 districts must reference the correct procedures. When new versions are published, previous versions remain accessible for reference and audit purposes but are clearly marked as superseded.

This version control implementation acknowledges Nepal's formal hierarchical approval processes while providing mechanisms to efficiently track changes, streamline reviews, and maintain authoritative policy documents that guide government operations.
