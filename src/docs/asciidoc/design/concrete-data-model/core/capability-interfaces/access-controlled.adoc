*Implementation Details:*
The Digital Land Registry System implements the AccessControlled interface to provide fine-grained permissions for land records. This implementation ensures only authorized individuals can view or modify sensitive land ownership data while enabling necessary sharing capabilities.

Land owner Asha Gurung creates a new land record in the system for her property in Lamjung district. As the creator, she automatically receives ADMIN permission on the record, which grants her full control over who can access it. The system generates an initial Access Control List (ACL) for the land parcel with Asha as the only entry.

When Asha hires lawyer Ajay Sharma to help with a boundary dispute, she grants him VIEW permission to access the land record. Lawyer Ajay can now view the details but receives an "Access Denied" message when attempting to edit the record, as he lacks EDIT permission. After Asha upgrades Ajay's permissions to include EDIT capability, he can make necessary changes to help prepare documents for the boundary dispute resolution.

The system also implements role-based permission overrides. When Land Registry Officer Sita Thapa accesses the record, she can view it automatically without explicit permission from Asha because her role "LAND_REGISTRY_OFFICER" has system-wide VIEW permissions for all land records. Similarly, District Chief Land Officer Ramesh Adhikari can view the complete access control list due to his administrative role.

When the legal work is completed, Asha revokes all of Ajay's permissions. The system maintains a detailed audit log of all permission changes, recording who granted or revoked permissions, when, and for what purpose.

The AccessControlled implementation provides:
1. Owner-based controls (where the record creator has full control)
2. Permission granularity (with distinct permissions like VIEW, EDIT, DELETE)
3. Delegation capabilities (the ability to grant and revoke permissions)
4. Role-based overrides (for administrative and regulatory access)
5. Comprehensive audit trails (tracking all permission changes)

*Technical Implementation Example:*
```kotlin
class LandParcel : BaseEntity(), AccessControlled {
    @ManyToOne
    private lateinit var owner: User
    
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "entity", cascade = [CascadeType.ALL])
    private val accessControlEntries: MutableSet<AccessControlEntry> = mutableSetOf()
    
    // Implementation of AccessControlled interface
    override fun getOwner(): User = owner
    
    override fun getAccessControlList(): Set<AccessControlEntry> {
        return accessControlEntries.toSet()
    }
    
    override fun hasPermission(user: User, permission: Permission): Boolean {
        // Owner always has all permissions
        if (user.id == owner.id) {
            return true
        }
        
        // Check for direct permission
        val hasDirectPermission = accessControlEntries.any { 
            it.user.id == user.id && it.permission == permission 
        }
        
        if (hasDirectPermission) {
            return true
        }
        
        // Check for role-based permission overrides
        return SecurityService.hasRoleBasedPermission(user, this, permission)
    }
    
    override fun grantPermission(user: User, permission: Permission) {
        val existingEntry = accessControlEntries.find { it.user.id == user.id }
        
        if (existingEntry != null) {
            existingEntry.permission = permission
        } else {
            val newEntry = AccessControlEntry(
                entity = this,
                user = user,
                permission = permission,
                grantedBy = SecurityContext.getCurrentUser(),
                grantedAt = Instant.now()
            )
            accessControlEntries.add(newEntry)
        }
        
        AuditLogger.logPermissionChange(this, user, permission, "GRANT")
    }
    
    override fun revokePermission(user: User, permission: Permission) {
        accessControlEntries.removeIf { 
            it.user.id == user.id && it.permission == permission 
        }
        
        AuditLogger.logPermissionChange(this, user, permission, "REVOKE")
    }
    
    override fun getEffectivePermissions(user: User): Set<Permission> {
        val permissions = mutableSetOf<Permission>()
        
        // Owner has all permissions
        if (user.id == owner.id) {
            return Permission.values().toSet()
        }
        
        // Add direct permissions
        permissions.addAll(
            accessControlEntries
                .filter { it.user.id == user.id }
                .map { it.permission }
        )
        
        // Add role-based permissions
        permissions.addAll(SecurityService.getRoleBasedPermissions(user, this))
        
        return permissions
    }
}
```
