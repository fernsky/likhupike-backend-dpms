*Implementation Details:*
The Kathmandu Municipal Business License System leverages ApprovableEntity to manage the complex workflow for restaurant permit applications. Restaurant owner Ram Sharma begins by creating an application which starts in DRAFT state. After completing the required fields, he uploads supporting documents and submits the application, changing its state to PENDING.

Municipal Officer Sita Thapa receives the application, validates basic requirements, and assigns it to Inspector Hari Prasad. After site inspection, Hari identifies a minor fire safety issue and sets the application to ACTION_NEEDED state with a detailed explanation in reviewNote. The system automatically notifies Ram, who uploads the updated fire safety certificate and resubmits.

When the application returns to IN_REVIEW, the system increments the resubmissionCount (now 1). When all requirements are verified, Sita approves the application, setting isApproved to true, recording herself as approvedBy, and updating the reviewState to APPROVED. The system then generates a formal license certificate with a one-year validity period.

This implementation leverages several ApprovableEntity features:
- The reviewState field tracks the application through its lifecycle
- The currentAssignee changes as the application moves between departments
- The priorityLevel is escalated for applications pending more than 30 days
- The dueDate helps officers prioritize urgent applications
- The previousReviewers list maintains a record of all officers involved in the process

The system includes specialized features for complex applications:
- Escalation triggers after applications exceed their dueDate
- Applications with higher resubmissionCount get additional scrutiny
- Applications with notes from senior officials get higher priorityLevel

*Technical Implementation Example:*
```kotlin
abstract class ApprovableEntity : SoftDeletableEntity() {
    var isApproved: Boolean = false
    
    var approvedAt: Instant? = null
    
    @ManyToOne
    var approvedBy: User? = null
    
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    var reviewState: ReviewState = ReviewState.DRAFT
    
    var reviewNote: String? = null
    
    var workflowInstanceId: String? = null
    
    @ManyToOne
    var currentAssignee: User? = null
    
    @ManyToMany
    var previousReviewers: MutableSet<User> = mutableSetOf()
    
    var escalationLevel: Int = 0
    
    var dueDate: LocalDate? = null
    
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    var priorityLevel: PriorityLevel = PriorityLevel.MEDIUM
    
    var resubmissionCount: Int = 0
    
    fun submit() {
        validateSubmissionRequirements()
        this.reviewState = ReviewState.PENDING
    }
    
    fun approve(approver: User) {
        validateApprovalRequirements()
        this.isApproved = true
        this.approvedAt = Instant.now()
        this.approvedBy = approver
        this.reviewState = ReviewState.APPROVED
    }
    
    fun requestChanges(reviewer: User, note: String) {
        this.reviewState = ReviewState.ACTION_NEEDED
        this.reviewNote = note
        this.previousReviewers.add(reviewer)
    }
    
    fun resubmit() {
        this.reviewState = ReviewState.IN_REVIEW
        this.resubmissionCount++
    }
}
```
