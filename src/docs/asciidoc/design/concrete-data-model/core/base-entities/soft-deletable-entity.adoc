*Implementation Details:*
The Ministry of Finance document management system uses SoftDeletableEntity to implement a document lifecycle that includes careful handling of deletion and potential restoration. This implementation addresses government requirements for records management, including retention policies and deletion governance.

Records Officer Manju Gurung marks an outdated budget report as deleted when it's superseded by a new version. The document appears in the recycling bin but remains in the database with `isDeleted = true`. When searched through normal channels, the document won't appear in search results due to the automatic filter on the `isDeleted` flag.

During an audit, Department Head Rajesh discovers this document is still needed for reference. He restores it from the recycling bin, which clears the `isDeleted` flag, sets `restoredAt` to the current time, and records himself as `restoredBy`. The system logs this restoration event for compliance purposes.

Later, when the document is truly no longer needed, a permanent deletion request is submitted. This follows a formal governance process, including verification against the document retention policy (minimum 7 years for financial documents), archival for historical records, and final secure deletion from the system.

The system implements specialized governance controls for deletion:
- Different authorization levels based on document classification (confidential documents require department head approval)
- Mandatory waiting periods before permanent deletion (30 days in recycle bin)
- Automatic restoration triggers (e.g., if referenced in a new document)
- Batch deletion approval workflows for routine document purges
- Special handling for legally significant documents

*Technical Implementation Example:*
```kotlin
abstract class SoftDeletableEntity : BaseEntity() {
    var isDeleted: Boolean = false
    
    var deletedAt: Instant? = null
    
    @ManyToOne
    var deletedBy: User? = null
    
    var deletionReason: String? = null
    
    var restoredAt: Instant? = null
    
    @ManyToOne
    var restoredBy: User? = null
    
    // Extended fields for government records management
    var permanentDeletionRequested: Boolean = false
    var permanentDeletionRequestedAt: Instant? = null
    
    @ManyToOne
    var permanentDeletionRequestedBy: User? = null
    
    var permanentDeletionReason: String? = null
    var retentionExpiryDate: LocalDate? = null
    
    fun softDelete(user: User, reason: String) {
        this.isDeleted = true
        this.deletedAt = Instant.now()
        this.deletedBy = user
        this.deletionReason = reason
    }
    
    fun restore(user: User, reason: String) {
        this.isDeleted = false
        this.restoredAt = Instant.now()
        this.restoredBy = user
        this.restoreReason = reason
    }
}
```
