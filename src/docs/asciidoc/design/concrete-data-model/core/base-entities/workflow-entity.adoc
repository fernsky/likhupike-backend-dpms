*Implementation Details:*
The Kathmandu Metropolitan City's Citizen Grievance Management System uses WorkflowEntity to track and resolve citizen complaints through a structured process. This implementation ensures accountability, timely responses, and proper service delivery.

The process begins when citizen Deepak Lama submits a complaint about water supply issues in his neighborhood. The system creates a Grievance entity with an initial state of "SUBMITTED" and assigns it a tracking number that Deepak can use to monitor progress.

A service desk officer assigns the grievance to the Water Department, changing its state to "UNDER_REVIEW" and setting a 2-day deadline for initial assessment. The system records this state transition in the previousStates collection and updates the assignee to the Water Department.

After reviewing the grievance, the Water Department officer determines technical assessment is needed and creates a task within the workflow. The state changes to "ASSESSMENT_NEEDED" and the task is assigned to the Engineering Department with its own 3-day deadline. The task ID is stored in activeTaskIds to track its completion.

Once the Engineering Department completes their assessment, they mark the task as complete, which updates the activeTaskIds collection. The Water Department resolves the issue, changing the state to "RESOLVED" and providing resolution details.

When notified of the resolution, Deepak disputes it because the problem continues intermittently. This triggers a state change to "RESOLUTION_DISPUTED" and an automatic escalation to the Water Department Head with a 1-day deadline, demonstrating how the workflow handles exceptions and escalations.

Throughout this process, WorkflowEntity provides:
- Clear state tracking and history with previousStates
- Deadline management with stateDeadline to ensure timely responses
- Assignment tracking with assignee and state-specific responsibilities
- Task management with activeTaskIds for complex workflows
- Escalation support with escalationLevel for dispute resolution
- Comprehensive state transition history for accountability

The system supports many other citizen-government interactions, including business license applications, construction permit reviews, and voter registration processes, all leveraging the same WorkflowEntity capabilities with different workflow definitions.
