*Implementation Details:*
The Nepal Ministry of Communications and Information Technology uses PublishableEntity to manage the lifecycle of official government policies. This implementation ensures proper review, versioning, and scheduled publication of critically important public-facing content.

Policy Officer Nirmala creates a new Digital Literacy Framework document, which begins in DRAFT status. She works on the initial content over several days, updating it as needed. When the draft is complete, she marks it as readyForReview, which notifies Department Head Rajesh.

After Rajesh reviews and approves the policy, Minister Bharat schedules it for publication the following Monday at 9 AM to coincide with a major announcement. The publishStatus changes to SCHEDULED, and a scheduledPublishAt date is set. When that date arrives, the system automatically changes the status to PUBLISHED, records the current timestamp as publishedAt, and sets highlightUntil to ensure the new policy appears in the "Recently Published" section for two weeks.

The policy document receives a publicationVersion of 1.0, and the system creates a permanent snapshot of this version. Six months later, when the revised framework is ready, the policy automatically unpublishes on the scheduled date, making way for the newer version.

For the policy revision, Officer Nirmala creates a new draft based on the original, updates it with new content, and sends it through the approval workflow again. When published, it receives an incremented publicationVersion of 2.0, and the previous version is archived for historical reference.

The system implements several publication-specific features:
1. Automatic scheduling of both publication and unpublication
2. Version tracking for multiple publication cycles
3. Historical archiving of previous policy versions
4. "Recently published" highlighting for important new content
5. Publication notes for internal context about timing decisions
6. Conditional publication based on approval status (autoPublish)

*Technical Implementation Example:*
```kotlin
abstract class PublishableEntity : ApprovableEntity() {
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    var publishStatus: PublishStatus = PublishStatus.DRAFT
    
    var publishedAt: Instant? = null
    
    @ManyToOne
    var publishedBy: User? = null
    
    var unpublishedAt: Instant? = null
    
    @ManyToOne
    var unpublishedBy: User? = null
    
    var scheduledPublishAt: Instant? = null
    
    var scheduledUnpublishAt: Instant? = null
    
    var autoPublish: Boolean = false
    
    var publicationVersion: String? = null
    
    var publicationNotes: String? = null
    
    var highlightUntil: LocalDate? = null
    
    var readyForReview: Boolean = false
    
    fun publish(publisher: User) {
        validateCanPublish()
        this.publishStatus = PublishStatus.PUBLISHED
        this.publishedAt = Instant.now()
        this.publishedBy = publisher
        if (this.publicationVersion == null) {
            this.publicationVersion = "1.0"
        }
    }
    
    fun unpublish(unpublisher: User) {
        validateCanUnpublish()
        this.publishStatus = PublishStatus.UNPUBLISHED
        this.unpublishedAt = Instant.now()
        this.unpublishedBy = unpublisher
    }
    
    fun schedulePublication(scheduledDate: Instant) {
        validateCanSchedule()
        this.publishStatus = PublishStatus.SCHEDULED
        this.scheduledPublishAt = scheduledDate
    }
    
    fun isHighlighted(): Boolean {
        val current = LocalDate.now()
        return this.publishStatus == PublishStatus.PUBLISHED && 
               this.highlightUntil != null && 
               !current.isAfter(this.highlightUntil)
    }
    
    override fun approve(approver: User) {
        super.approve(approver)
        if (this.autoPublish) {
            this.publish(approver)
        }
    }
}

enum class PublishStatus {
    DRAFT,
    SCHEDULED,
    PUBLISHED,
    UNPUBLISHED
}
```
