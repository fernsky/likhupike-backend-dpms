*Implementation Details:*
The Pokhara Municipality Infrastructure Department uses SpatialEntity to plan and manage a new urban road project. This implementation ensures accurate geographic representation, impact analysis, and stakeholder coordination.

Municipal Engineer Binod creates a new road project entity, specifying its basic attributes. GIS Specialist Anjali then defines the actual geographic alignment of the proposed road, creating a LineString for the centerline. The system automatically calculates the road length as 2.5 kilometers. Using the road's planned width of 9 meters, the system generates a buffer polygon that represents the actual footprint of the road including shoulders and drainage.

With the road alignment defined, the system leverages its spatial capabilities to identify affected properties by performing a spatial intersection analysis with the land parcel database. The analysis finds 37 parcels that will be impacted by the new road. Using this information, the engineer updates the project metadata with the affected parcel count and estimates the land acquisition cost at NPR 125,000,000.

Seeking to minimize impact, the engineer runs an optimization process which uses constraint-based algorithms to suggest an alternative alignment that reduces property impacts while maintaining engineering standards. The system creates an alternative LineString and polygon for this optimized route, keeping both versions for comparison. After reviewing the alternatives, the engineer selects the optimized alignment as the final route.

Using the finalized road alignment, the system retrieves contact information for all affected property owners, and the notification service schedules a community meeting and sends formal notices to these stakeholders.

The SpatialEntity capabilities provide several critical functions in this context:
1. Accurate geographic representation of linear infrastructure
2. Buffer generation for impact footprint analysis
3. Spatial intersection to identify affected properties
4. Area calculation for cost estimation
5. Alternative alignment comparison
6. Spatial accuracy tracking to ensure engineering precision

The system also maintains metadata about the spatial data, including the source (SURVEY), spatial reference system (WGS84), and accuracy (0.5 meters), ensuring that engineering decisions are based on reliable geographic information.
