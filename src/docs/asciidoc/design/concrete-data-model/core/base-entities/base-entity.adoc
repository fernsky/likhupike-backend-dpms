*Implementation Details:*
The National Records Management System uses BaseEntity for all official citizen records. When Records Manager Prakash creates a new citizenship record, the system automatically generates a UUID, timestamps the creation, records Prakash as the creator, and calculates a SHA-256 hash of the record's content for integrity verification. The system also captures which government office created the record through the `origin` field.

The optimistic locking mechanism prevents data corruption when multiple offices try to update the same record simultaneously. For example, when both the Passport Office and the Electoral Commission attempt to update Anita Gurung's address at the same time, the second update fails with a version conflict, requiring manual resolution.

For cross-system integration, the externalId field stores references to legacy system identifiers. When integrating with the national ID card system, each citizen record maintains its original ID from that system (e.g., "NID-4295781"), enabling cross-reference between systems during the digital transition.

In a multi-tenant deployment, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Immigration, and Nepal Police each operate as separate tenants, with the tenant field ensuring that officials only access records relevant to their department, while maintaining a unified citizen identity across systems.

*Technical Implementation Example:*
```kotlin
abstract class BaseEntity {
    @Id
    val id: UUID = UUID.randomUUID()
    
    @CreationTimestamp
    val createdAt: Instant = Instant.now()
    
    @ManyToOne
    val createdBy: User? = null
    
    @UpdateTimestamp
    var updatedAt: Instant? = null
    
    @ManyToOne
    var updatedBy: User? = null
    
    @Version
    var version: Long = 0
    
    @Column(length = 64)
    var entityHash: String? = null
    
    var origin: String? = null
    
    var externalId: String? = null
    
    @ManyToOne
    var tenant: Tenant? = null
    
    fun calculateHash(): String {
        val digest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256")
        val hashableFields = this.getHashableFields()
        return digest.digest(hashableFields.toString().toByteArray()).encodeToBase64String()
    }
    
    protected abstract fun getHashableFields(): List<Any?>
}
```
