*Implementation Details:*
The Government Departments and Services Directory uses NamedEntity to manage official department information across multiple languages and for public-facing interfaces. This implementation enables a user-friendly government portal with robust multilingual support.

Ministry Administrator Kabita creates a new department record for the Department of Land Management, providing both English and Nepali information. The system automatically generates a URL-friendly slug, concatenates relevant fields into searchableText, and creates a display variant of the name that includes the code.

For multilingual support, translation keys are created for both the name and description, with translations stored in the localization service. When citizen Pradeep views the department in the Nepali interface, the system fetches the localized content through these translation keys.

The search functionality leverages the searchableText field, which contains denormalized content for optimal search performance. This allows citizens to find departments using various keywords, even if they don't know the exact department name.

For departmental directories and listings, the system uses sortableName, which removes articles like "The" and "Department of" for natural alphabetical sorting. This ensures "Land Management" and "Agriculture" appear under L and A respectively, rather than both under D for "Department of...".

Special features implemented include:
1. Integration codes for cross-system references (code field)
2. Mobile-friendly abbreviated names (shortName field)
3. Hierarchical department relationships (parent-child associations)
4. Multilingual support through translation keys
5. SEO-friendly URL slugs
6. Full-text search optimization

*Technical Implementation Example:*
```kotlin
abstract class NamedEntity : BaseEntity() {
    @Column(nullable = false)
    var name: String = ""
    
    var nameTranslationKey: String? = null
    
    @Column(length = 1000)
    var description: String? = null
    
    var descTranslationKey: String? = null
    
    @Column(unique = true)
    var slug: String = ""
    
    var code: String? = null
    
    var displayName: String? = null
    
    var shortName: String? = null
    
    @Column(length = 2000)
    var searchableText: String? = null
    
    var sortableName: String? = null
    
    @PrePersist
    @PreUpdate
    fun prepareEntity() {
        if (slug.isEmpty()) {
            slug = generateSlug(name)
        }
        
        if (sortableName == null) {
            sortableName = generateSortableName(name)
        }
        
        if (searchableText == null) {
            searchableText = buildSearchableText()
        }
    }
    
    private fun generateSlug(input: String): String {
        return input.toLowerCase()
            .replace(Regex("[^a-z0-9\\s-]"), "")
            .replace(Regex("\\s+"), "-")
    }
    
    private fun generateSortableName(input: String): String {
        return input.replace(Regex("^(The|A|An|Department of|Ministry of)\\s+"), "")
            .trim()
    }
    
    private fun buildSearchableText(): String {
        val parts = mutableListOf<String>()
        parts.add(name)
        description?.let { parts.add(it) }
        code?.let { parts.add(it) }
        displayName?.let { parts.add(it) }
        shortName?.let { parts.add(it) }
        return parts.joinToString(" ")
    }
}
```
