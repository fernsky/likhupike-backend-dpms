=== Location Domain Model

This section details the concrete implementation of the Location Domain, building upon the core domain models.

==== Domain Overview

The Location Domain represents the geographical and administrative divisions within the Digital Profile system. It implements a hierarchical model of administrative entities that directly leverages the core domain models.

==== Core Domain Model Integration

The Location Domain demonstrates a comprehensive implementation of the core domain models through:

===== Inheritance

Each location entity extends appropriate base classes:

|===
| Entity | Extends | Purpose
| Province | NamedEntity, ApprovableEntity | Base structure and approval workflow
| District | NamedEntity, ApprovableEntity | Base structure and approval workflow
| Municipality | NamedEntity, ApprovableEntity | Base structure and approval workflow
| Ward | NamedEntity, ApprovableEntity | Base structure and approval workflow
| SettlementArea | NamedEntity, SpatialEntity | Base structure and spatial attributes
| LocationBoundary | SpatialEntity | Geographic boundary management
|===

===== Capabilities

Location entities implement interfaces based on their specific needs:

|===
| Entity | Implements | Capability
| Province | HistoryViewable | Tracks province changes over time
| | AccessControlled | Manages federal/provincial permissions
| | ExternalSystemSyncable | Synchronizes with national systems
| District | HistoryViewable | Tracks district changes over time
| | AccessControlled | Manages district-level permissions
| Municipality | HistoryViewable | Tracks boundary and status changes
| | AccessControlled | Manages municipal permissions
| | GeocodingCapable | Resolves addresses within boundaries
| | WebhookTriggerable | Notifies systems of changes
| Ward | HistoryViewable | Tracks changes over time
| | GeocodingCapable | Resolves addresses at ward level
| SettlementArea | LocalizedEntity | Supports multiple languages for settlement names
|===

===== Components

The Location Domain utilizes reusable components from the core domain:

|===
| Component | Used By | Purpose
| AddressComponent | Province, District, Municipality | Standardized location representation 
| ContactInformation | Province, District, Municipality | Administrative contact details
| LocationBoundary | All spatial entities | Boundary management with versioning
| AddressFormat | Municipality | Address standardization and validation
| OperationalHours | Municipality (government offices) | Operating hours for administrative offices
|===

==== Implementation of Core Patterns

The Location Domain implements several key patterns from the core domain model:

===== Soft Deletion Pattern

Location entities leverage the `SoftDeletableEntity` capabilities for safe deprecation:

```kotlin
// When a municipality is merged or dissolved
municipality.isDeleted = true
municipality.deletedAt = LocalDateTime.now()
municipality.deletedBy = currentUser
municipality.deletionReason = "Municipal merger with ${targetMunicipality.name}"

// Reference preserved in historical records
newMunicipality.formerMunicipalityIds.add(municipality.id)
```

===== Approval Workflow Pattern

The Location Domain extensively uses the `ApprovableEntity` workflow for boundary changes:

```kotlin
// Province creation follows the standard approval flow
province.reviewState = ReviewState.DRAFT       // Initial creation
province.reviewState = ReviewState.PENDING     // Submitted for review
province.reviewState = ReviewState.IN_REVIEW   // Under review by federal authorities
province.reviewState = ReviewState.APPROVED    // Approved by authorized officials
province.isApproved = true
province.approvedBy = federalAdmin
province.approvedAt = LocalDateTime.now()
```

===== Version History Pattern

All boundary changes use the core version tracking capabilities:

```kotlin
// When a district boundary changes
val oldBoundary = district.getBoundary()
val newBoundary = LocationBoundary(
    entityId = district.id,
    entityType = "District",
    effectiveFrom = effectiveDate,
    boundary = newBoundaryPolygon,
    previousVersionId = oldBoundary.id,
    versionNumber = oldBoundary.versionNumber + 1
)

// Old boundary remains in the system
oldBoundary.effectiveTo = effectiveDate.minusDays(1)
```

==== Common Patterns

===== Entity Lifecycle

All location entities follow a consistent lifecycle pattern:

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
' Common states from ApprovableEntity
[*] --> Draft : create
Draft --> Pending : submit
Pending --> InReview : assign
InReview --> Rejected : reject
InReview --> Approved : approve
Rejected --> Draft : revise

' Location-specific extensions
Approved --> Active : activate
Active --> UnderChange : proposeChange
UnderChange --> InReview : submitChange
Active --> Deprecated : phase out
Deprecated --> Historical : archive
Historical --> [*]

===== Boundary Management

All location boundaries are managed using the LocationBoundary entity:

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
class LocationBoundary {
  +UUID id
  +UUID entityId
  +String entityType
  +LocalDate effectiveFrom
  +LocalDate effectiveTo
  
  +Polygon boundary
  +Polygon simplifiedBoundary
  +Point centroid
  +BoundingBox bbox
  
  +Double areaInSquareKm
  +Double perimeterInKm
  +SpatialAccuracy accuracy
  
  +UUID previousVersionId
  +Integer versionNumber
}
@enduml
----

===== Administrative Hierarchy

Location entities maintain a strict hierarchy with upward referencing:

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
class SettlementArea {
  +UUID wardId
  +UUID municipalityId
  +UUID districtId
  +UUID provinceId
}

class Ward {
  +UUID municipalityId
  +UUID districtId
  +UUID provinceId
}

class Municipality {
  +UUID districtId
  +UUID provinceId
}

class District {
  +UUID provinceId
}

class Province

Province <-- District : provinceId
District <-- Municipality : districtId
Province <-- Municipality : provinceId
Municipality <-- Ward : municipalityId
District <-- Ward : districtId
Province <-- Ward : provinceId
Ward <-- SettlementArea : wardId
Municipality <-- SettlementArea : municipalityId
District <-- SettlementArea : districtId
Province <-- SettlementArea : provinceId

===== Cross-Entity Validation

Location entities implement hierarchical validation to ensure containment integrity:

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
participant "LocationService" as Service
participant "ProvinceValidator" as ProvinceVal
participant "DistrictValidator" as DistrictVal
participant "MunicipalityValidator" as MuniVal
participant "WardValidator" as WardVal

Service -> DistrictVal : validateDistrict(district)
activate DistrictVal
DistrictVal -> DistrictVal : validateBasicAttributes()
DistrictVal -> ProvinceVal : validateDistrictInProvince(district, province)
DistrictVal <-- ProvinceVal : containmentValidation
Service <-- DistrictVal : districtValidation
deactivate DistrictVal

Service -> MuniVal : validateMunicipality(municipality)
activate MuniVal
MuniVal -> MuniVal : validateBasicAttributes()
MuniVal -> DistrictVal : validateMunicipalityInDistrict(municipality, district)
MuniVal <-- DistrictVal : containmentValidation
Service <-- MuniVal : municipalityValidation
deactivate MuniVal

Service -> WardVal : validateWard(ward)
activate WardVal
WardVal -> WardVal : validateBasicAttributes()
WardVal -> MuniVal : validateWardInMunicipality(ward, municipality)
WardVal <-- MuniVal : containmentValidation
Service <-- WardVal : wardValidation
deactivate WardVal
@enduml

===== Event-Driven Updates

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
participant "LocationService" as Service
participant "Municipality" as Municipality
participant "DomainEventPublisher" as Publisher
participant "NotificationService" as Notification
participant "SpatialIndexService" as Spatial
participant "AddressService" as Address

Service -> Municipality : updateBoundary(newBoundary)
activate Municipality

Municipality -> Publisher : publish(MunicipalityBoundaryChangedEvent)
activate Publisher

Publisher -> Notification : handleEvent(event)
Publisher -> Spatial : handleEvent(event)
Publisher -> Address : handleEvent(event)

Municipality <-- Publisher
deactivate Publisher

Service <-- Municipality
deactivate Municipality

==== Key Domain Events

The Location Domain publishes several important domain events:

|===
| Event | Description | Published By | Subscribers
| ProvinceCreatedEvent | New province created | ProvinceService | DistrictService, ReportingService, MapService
| ProvinceBoundaryChangedEvent | Province boundary modified | ProvinceService | DistrictService, AddressService, MapService
| DistrictCreatedEvent | New district created | DistrictService | MunicipalityService, ReportingService
| DistrictBoundaryChangedEvent | District boundary modified | DistrictService | MunicipalityService, AddressService
| MunicipalityCreatedEvent | New municipality created | MunicipalityService | WardService, CitizenService
| MunicipalityTypeChangedEvent | Municipality type changed | MunicipalityService | ServiceDeliverySystem, BudgetingSystem
| WardCreatedEvent | New ward created | WardService | SettlementService, AddressService
| SettlementAreaCreatedEvent | New settlement area created | SettlementService | InfrastructureService, PlanningService
|===

==== Security and Access Control

The Location Domain implements a hierarchical security model leveraging the `AccessControlled` capabilities:

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
actor "Federal Admin" as FedAdmin
actor "Province Admin" as ProvAdmin
actor "District Admin" as DistAdmin
actor "Municipality Admin" as MuniAdmin
actor "Ward Officer" as WardOff
actor "Citizen" as Citizen

rectangle "Province" as Province
rectangle "District" as District
rectangle "Municipality" as Municipality
rectangle "Ward" as Ward
rectangle "Settlement" as Settlement

FedAdmin --> Province : ADMIN
ProvAdmin --> Province : EDIT
ProvAdmin --> District : ADMIN
DistAdmin --> District : EDIT
DistAdmin --> Municipality : ADMIN
MuniAdmin --> Municipality : EDIT
MuniAdmin --> Ward : ADMIN
WardOff --> Ward : EDIT
WardOff --> Settlement : ADMIN
Citizen --> Province : VIEW
Citizen --> District : VIEW
Citizen --> Municipality : VIEW
Citizen --> Ward : VIEW
Citizen --> Settlement : VIEW

note right of FedAdmin
  Each administrative level has ADMIN 
  permissions for their level and EDIT
  for the level above.
  
  VIEW permission is available to
  all authenticated users.
end note

==== API Integration Patterns

The Location Domain leverages the WebhookTriggerable interface to notify external systems of changes:

```kotlin
// When a municipality's type changes
municipality.triggerWebhooks(
    event = "MUNICIPALITY_TYPE_CHANGED",
    payload = mapOf(
        "municipalityId" = municipality.id,
        "municipalityCode" = municipality.municipalityCode,
        "oldType" = oldType.name,
        "newType" = newType.name,
        "effectiveDate" = effectiveDate.toString(),
        "approvedBy" = currentUser.username
    )
)
```

==== Data Governance Implementation

The Location Domain implements the core data governance patterns:

```kotlin
// Province definition implements ExternalSystemSyncable
// to synchronize with national information systems
province.markForSync(SyncPriority.HIGH)
val syncId = province.getExternalSystemId() // "NIS-PROVINCE-1"
val syncUrl = province.getExternalSystemUrl() // "https://nis.gov.example/api/provinces/1"
val syncStatus = province.getSyncStatus() // SyncStatus.PENDING
```

==== Location Domain Entities

Each entity in the Location Domain has a specific role and responsibility within the system:

include::location/province.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::location/district.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::location/municipality.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::location/ward.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::location/settlement-area.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
