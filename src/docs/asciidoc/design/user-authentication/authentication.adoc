=== Authentication Mechanism

_Document the authentication flow, token management, and security protocols here._

==== Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials
2. System validates credentials
3. System generates JWT token
4. User includes token in subsequent requests
5. System validates token for each request

==== Security Considerations

* Password hashing using BCrypt
* Short-lived JWT tokens
* HTTPS for all communications
* Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
* Account lockout after failed attempts
