=== Data Model

The Citizen Management System's data model is designed to accurately represent citizen identity information, document management, and state tracking throughout the verification and approval process.

The model centers around the Citizen entity which stores personal and contact details. Associated entities like CitizenDocument manage uploaded identification documents, while CitizenVerification tracks the verification status and approval process for each citizen.
