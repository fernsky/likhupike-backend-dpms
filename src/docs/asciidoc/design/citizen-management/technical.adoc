=== Technical Considerations

_Document technical considerations specific to citizen management:_

==== State Management

* Design pattern for managing complex state transitions
* State history tracking and audit trail
* State-dependent validations and permissions
* State-driven workflow engine

==== Document Processing

* Server-side document validation
* Image processing for verification
* Document comparison algorithms
* OCR capabilities for data extraction from documents (future)
